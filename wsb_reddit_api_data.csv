6,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",367.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

8,Are we expecting higher inflation over the next several months?,327.0,"Just last month, inflation rose to 0.6%. This is just among the series of inflations that began in April (0.8%) and March (0.6%) this year. I was scrolling through this [newsletter](https://karlstack.substack.com/p/polymarket-prediction-june-inflation) and it gave me some insight as to how CPI will probably reach 0.6% again for June. I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings. 

With this development, I’m contemplating on trading a forecast in Polymarket, seeing how there is a possibility that we get more inflation in the coming months.",2021-07-10 12:51:47,Choice-Many-9550

Are you willing to trade in fake monopoly money?

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

18,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,15.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

GME

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

19,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,92.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

24,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,5.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

Thanks for reading – if this was halfway decent, please let me know - would love to do more, this was fun to write! If it is dog shit, please also let me know so I can try harder next time lol.",2021-07-10 19:12:41,occasionalgambler

The advent of technology is changing banking, resulting in artificial intelligence's (AI) deployment in data collection, data integration, and analysis.

According to an IndustryArc report, the Fintech market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2021 to 2026, and is anticipated to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026.

Using the TipRanks [stock comparison](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=SOFI&amp;ticker=UPST) tool, let us compare two retail companies, SoFi Technologies and Upstart Holdings, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4gd7muc7a71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34538a36b5835417e5fc7ccd8641fa9d0a188abe

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

54,$GGB huge potential,2.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

58,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,16.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

63,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,413.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

85,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1677.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,5.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

108,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",363.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

This is just among the series of inflations that began in April (0.8%) and March (0.6%) this year. I was scrolling through this [newsletter](https://karlstack.substack.com/p/polymarket-prediction-june-inflation) and it gave me some insight as to how CPI will probably reach 0.6% again for June. I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings. 

With this development, I’m contemplating on trading a forecast in Polymarket, seeing how there is a possibility that we get more inflation in the coming months.",2021-07-10 12:51:47,Choice-Many-9550

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots.

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

120,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,18.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

GME

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

121,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,89.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

126,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,2.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

132,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

&amp;#x200B;

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

156,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

160,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,20.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

178,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,51.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

# VI. That's all.

I was not intending to go so hard on this DD but what can I say? I love you guys. Now, please, make me fucking rich.

https://preview.redd.it/sf2idk0lp7a71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a2bb8815f89bf5ef84104e9775e85d16ca852e2

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

\*[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market)

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

187,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1675.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,3.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

210,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",372.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

Are you willing to trade in fake monopoly money?

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Those were cool, I guess. I can't read but maybe someone can translate.

**Current Events**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

223,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,95.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

Now let me be really clear: I'm talking specifically about people who make money on stocks going down. They're not living in the woods y'all. They don't have bloody twig diarrhea or facial scarring from eating raw honey. They didn't have to scratch their backs on a log to dislodge ticks or eat raw salmon when they couldn't get a fire going. Hell my phone was turned off the whole time cuz there's nowhere to charge it! How is someone out here going to make any money this way, let alone shaving or wearing clothes. At one point I even had to break into some camper's cooler and steal food.

228,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,4.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

234,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

Using the TipRanks [stock comparison](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=SOFI&amp;ticker=UPST) tool, let us compare two retail companies, SoFi Technologies and Upstart Holdings, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4gd7muc7a71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34538a36b5835417e5fc7ccd8641fa9d0a188abe

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

258,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

262,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,18.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

267,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,416.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

280,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,50.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

\---

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

\*[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market)

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

289,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1676.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings.

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

324,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,18.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

&amp;#x200B;

325,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,93.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

327,AMC was delisted from threshold. Here's my Analysis of the threshold listing.,82.0," **- Dec Threshold Listing Timing of AMC and Prediction of Rising Timing after Threshold Listing in June AMC Based on Past Data -**

Closed days are not reflected in the calculation of business days!

**12/17\~12/28** Threshold Listed (**total 7** business days)

\-&gt; Started rising on January 22 (**2.33 $** ), and highest on January 27 (**$ 20.36**).

(This date is 25 days from 12/17 and 18 days from 12/28, and has risen for 5 days) .

This time ,

**6/25 \~ 7/8** Threshold Listed (**total 9** business days)

\-&gt; After 25 days from 6/25 = **7/30** , After 18 days from 7/8 = **8/3** is.

The date calculation may have an error of several days, but the specific date is not important. From the end of July to the beginning of August, it can be expected that the increase will start. I think the past record can be more objective than the distribution of call options or the phrase “compulsory liquidation after 13 days.” and so on.

During my time living amongst the beautiful nature and wildlife of these majestic woodlands I discovered one undeniable fact; there is no such thing as a bear and there never was. 

Now let me be really clear: I'm talking specifically about people who make money on stocks going down. They're not living in the woods y'all. They don't have bloody twig diarrhea or facial scarring from eating raw honey. They didn't have to scratch their backs on a log to dislodge ticks or eat raw salmon when they couldn't get a fire going. Hell my phone was turned off the whole time cuz there's nowhere to charge it! How is someone out here going to make any money this way, let alone shaving or wearing clothes. At one point I even had to break into some camper's cooler and steal food. I'm not ashamed to admit I visited that campground a few times and there was a dumpster there I relied on during the harsher months.

330,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,3.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

336,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

The advent of technology is changing banking, resulting in artificial intelligence's (AI) deployment in data collection, data integration, and analysis.

According to an IndustryArc report, the Fintech market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2021 to 2026, and is anticipated to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026.

Using the TipRanks [stock comparison](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=SOFI&amp;ticker=UPST) tool, let us compare two retail companies, SoFi Technologies and Upstart Holdings, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

360,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

364,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,16.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

369,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,414.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

382,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,50.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

391,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1678.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,2.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

414,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",368.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience.

416,Are we expecting higher inflation over the next several months?,329.0,"Just last month, inflation rose to 0.6%. This is just among the series of inflations that began in April (0.8%) and March (0.6%) this year. I was scrolling through this [newsletter](https://karlstack.substack.com/p/polymarket-prediction-june-inflation) and it gave me some insight as to how CPI will probably reach 0.6% again for June. I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings. 

With this development, I’m contemplating on trading a forecast in Polymarket, seeing how there is a possibility that we get more inflation in the coming months.",2021-07-10 12:51:47,Choice-Many-9550

Are you willing to trade in fake monopoly money?

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

**Current Events**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

426,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,18.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

&amp;#x200B;

427,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,90.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

432,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,3.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank. 

The End (Or Out to Lunch)

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

438,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

462,$GGB huge potential,1.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

466,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,22.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

484,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,52.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

# VI. That's all.

https://preview.redd.it/sf2idk0lp7a71.png?width=1200&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8a2bb8815f89bf5ef84104e9775e85d16ca852e2

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

493,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1677.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

505,DD on BLDR! Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,3.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

516,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",368.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings.

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Those were cool, I guess. I can't read but maybe someone can translate.

**Current Events**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

528,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,15.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

529,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,94.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.




I hope you enjoyed reading my personal take on the overall situation regarding $SPCE. And I wish all of you a good evening.",2021-07-10 07:30:11,Skank_cunt_42

531,AMC was delisted from threshold. Here's my Analysis of the threshold listing.,77.0," **- Dec Threshold Listing Timing of AMC and Prediction of Rising Timing after Threshold Listing in June AMC Based on Past Data -**

Closed days are not reflected in the calculation of business days!

**12/17\~12/28** Threshold Listed (**total 7** business days)

\-&gt; Started rising on January 22 (**2.33 $** ), and highest on January 27 (**$ 20.36**).

(This date is 25 days from 12/17 and 18 days from 12/28, and has risen for 5 days) .

This time ,

**6/25 \~ 7/8** Threshold Listed (**total 9** business days)

\-&gt; After 25 days from 6/25 = **7/30** , After 18 days from 7/8 = **8/3** is.

The date calculation may have an error of several days, but the specific date is not important. From the end of July to the beginning of August, it can be expected that the increase will start. I think the past record can be more objective than the distribution of call options or the phrase “compulsory liquidation after 13 days.” and so on.

During my time living amongst the beautiful nature and wildlife of these majestic woodlands I discovered one undeniable fact; there is no such thing as a bear and there never was. 

Now let me be really clear: I'm talking specifically about people who make money on stocks going down. They're not living in the woods y'all. They don't have bloody twig diarrhea or facial scarring from eating raw honey. They didn't have to scratch their backs on a log to dislodge ticks or eat raw salmon when they couldn't get a fire going. Hell my phone was turned off the whole time cuz there's nowhere to charge it! How is someone out here going to make any money this way, let alone shaving or wearing clothes. At one point I even had to break into some camper's cooler and steal food. I'm not ashamed to admit I visited that campground a few times and there was a dumpster there I relied on during the harsher months.

534,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,4.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

540,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

Using the TipRanks [stock comparison](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=SOFI&amp;ticker=UPST) tool, let us compare two retail companies, SoFi Technologies and Upstart Holdings, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4gd7muc7a71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34538a36b5835417e5fc7ccd8641fa9d0a188abe

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

564,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

568,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,22.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

573,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,413.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

586,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,51.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

\---

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

\*[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market)

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases.

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

595,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1682.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

618,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",365.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

This is just among the series of inflations that began in April (0.8%) and March (0.6%) this year.

I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings.

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

[This is GME stock. Not relevant at all. Just proud of you retards](https://preview.redd.it/0q6p790gnea71.png?width=954&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7135ec956fd403ba6083ddf7a4001f99829b3c19)

Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

630,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,16.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

631,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,89.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

They didn't have to scratch their backs on a log to dislodge ticks or eat raw salmon when they couldn't get a fire going. Hell my phone was turned off the whole time cuz there's nowhere to charge it! How is someone out here going to make any money this way, let alone shaving or wearing clothes. At one point I even had to break into some camper's cooler and steal food. I'm not ashamed to admit I visited that campground a few times and there was a dumpster there I relied on during the harsher months. 

I did it for you guys, now I'm back on Robin Hood, secure in the knowledge that nobody is secretly betting against me in the woods. At least nobody that I noticed.",2021-07-10 03:14:26,HappyMediumGD

636,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,4.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

666,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

670,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,17.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

675,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,413.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

688,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,55.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

697,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1678.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,3.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

720,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",361.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots.

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

732,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,17.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

733,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,93.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

738,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,3.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank. 

The End (Or Out to Lunch)

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

744,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

768,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

772,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,20.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

790,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,53.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

\---

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

This leads to people deferring the purchase of new tires, leading to more bald tires on the road. This leads to more car accidents and insurance claim payouts.

Ergo, buy puts on the auto insurers. But don't really 'cause this ain't financial advice, *u kapiche?*.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

799,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1682.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

822,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",371.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings.

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Those were cool, I guess. I can't read but maybe someone can translate.

**Current Events**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

834,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,17.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

GME

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ga2p6b14xea71.png?width=1712&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=ebef27e824a720d8c5230cf8af903a78aab51a38

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/nom6zafoxea71.png?width=1704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4005cf390fd6ac223164841a16f79694eed267b

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

https://preview.redd.it/yxg1yvqq0fa71.png?width=1707&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c4de2a7766ec040e3e2cc55d9efcf66f754e0acd

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

835,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,92.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

\-&gt; After 25 days from 6/25 = **7/30** , After 18 days from 7/8 = **8/3** is.

The date calculation may have an error of several days, but the specific date is not important. From the end of July to the beginning of August, it can be expected that the increase will start. I think the past record can be more objective than the distribution of call options or the phrase “compulsory liquidation after 13 days.” and so on.

During my time living amongst the beautiful nature and wildlife of these majestic woodlands I discovered one undeniable fact; there is no such thing as a bear and there never was. 

Now let me be really clear: I'm talking specifically about people who make money on stocks going down. They're not living in the woods y'all. They don't have bloody twig diarrhea or facial scarring from eating raw honey. They didn't have to scratch their backs on a log to dislodge ticks or eat raw salmon when they couldn't get a fire going. Hell my phone was turned off the whole time cuz there's nowhere to charge it! How is someone out here going to make any money this way, let alone shaving or wearing clothes. At one point I even had to break into some camper's cooler and steal food. I'm not ashamed to admit I visited that campground a few times and there was a dumpster there I relied on during the harsher months.

840,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,3.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

846,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

Thanks for reading – if this was halfway decent, please let me know - would love to do more, this was fun to write! If it is dog shit, please also let me know so I can try harder next time lol.",2021-07-10 19:12:41,occasionalgambler

According to an IndustryArc report, the Fintech market is expected to grow at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.7% between 2021 to 2026, and is anticipated to be worth $161.2 billion by 2026.

Using the TipRanks [stock comparison](https://www.tipranks.com/compare-stocks/custom?ticker=SOFI&amp;ticker=UPST) tool, let us compare two retail companies, SoFi Technologies and Upstart Holdings, and see how Wall Street analysts feel about these stocks.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4gd7muc7a71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34538a36b5835417e5fc7ccd8641fa9d0a188abe

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

870,$GGB huge potential,1.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

874,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,17.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

879,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,419.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

892,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,50.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

(Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

\*[https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market](https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-cystic-fibrosis-cf-therapeutics-market)

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

901,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1671.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,3.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

924,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",366.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

This is just among the series of inflations that began in April (0.8%) and March (0.6%) this year. I was scrolling through this [newsletter](https://karlstack.substack.com/p/polymarket-prediction-june-inflation) and it gave me some insight as to how CPI will probably reach 0.6% again for June. I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings. 

With this development, I’m contemplating on trading a forecast in Polymarket, seeing how there is a possibility that we get more inflation in the coming months.",2021-07-10 12:51:47,Choice-Many-9550

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

936,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,16.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

GME

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/nom6zafoxea71.png?width=1704&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=b4005cf390fd6ac223164841a16f79694eed267b

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll review how well these models worked in a month or two.",2021-07-10 16:48:07,HoleyProfit
937,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,91.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

942,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,6.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank.

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

972,$GGB huge potential,0.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

976,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,19.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

981,$WISH is Worth $40 Deep Value and Huge Potential 🚀💎👐,417.0,"Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows. DCF analysis attempts to figure out the value of an investment today, based on projections of how much money it will generate in the future.

Below are the data sources, inputs and calculation used to determine the intrinsic value for ContextLogic.

Valuation Model	：2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

Levered Free Cash Flow：Average of 11 Analyst Estimates (S&amp;P Global)

Discount Rate (Cost of Equity)	6.9%

Perpetual Growth Rate	5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate	2.0%

An important part of a discounted cash flow is the discount rate, below we explain how it has been.


Calculation of Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity for NasdaqGS:WISH
 
Risk-Free Rate  (5-Year Average of US Long-Term Govt Bond Rate)	2.0%

Equity Risk Premium  (S&amp;P Global)	4.7%

Online Retail Unlevered Beta	(Simply Wall St/ S&amp;P Global)	1.05

Re-levered Beta	= 0.33 + [(0.66 * Unlevered beta) * (1 + (1 - tax rate) (Debt/Market Equity))]= 0.33 + [(0.66 * 1.049) * (1 + (1 - 21.0%) (0.70%))]	1.037

Levered Beta	Levered Beta limited to 0.8 to 2.0 (practical range for a stable firm)	  1.037

Discount Rate/ Cost of Equity	= Cost of Equity = Risk Free Rate + (Levered Beta * Equity Risk Premium)
= 1.99% + (1.037 * 4.72%)


Discounted Cash Flow Calculation for NasdaqGS:WISH using 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity

The calculations below outline how an intrinsic value for ContextLogic is arrived at by discounting future cash flows to their present value using the 2 stage method. We use analyst's estimates of cash flows going forward 10 years for the 1st stage, the 2nd stage assumes the company grows at a stable rate into perpetuity.

994,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,53.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals is a large-cap American biopharmaceutical company which uses rational drug design to develop treatments for several disorders. The stock has been long overlooked by retail investors but is no stranger to institutions -- massive hedge funds such as Renaissance Technologies, Point72 and Man Group are all long with large positions. Currently, there are several catalysts for growth in the upcoming years for Vertex. VRTX is the single best biotech stock to buy right now.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

&amp;#x200B;

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

1003,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1682.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,5.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.

1026,"What I have learned in my short journey about investing, and how not to screw it up (too much) in the attempt -- The common sense when doing DDs",366.0,"Hi everyone,

I am a novice investor. I started a year ago to get into the world of investment, when it became clear to me that if I wanted some financial solvency, I needed to do more than working 8h/day and putting my money in an account just losing its value. Since then, I have tried to learn as much as I can, through books, articles and of course internet.

I am still ignorant, I'm not gonna lie, and I still have a long way to go, as long as life itself, to start seeing results. But that's OK. It takes time, a lot of time, especially if investing is not your main task, as in my case.

Nevertheless, I can say that I am rather happy with what I have learnt. That is why I would like to share with you a summary of what I have been able to acquire.  I think that as I am still a novice, my point of view could be also useful for those who are still starting out like me. And of course, thanks also to those with more experience, who can contribute with their feedback.

Let's get started with the ""guide"" I use for investing.

# Before we start

1. There are certain terms that we need to remember very well. First, we must understand the basic principles for the accounting of a company:

|*Accounting*|*Where can you find it?*|*What does it explain?*|*How should it be?*|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|**Assets** \- **Liabilities** = **Net Equity** (also called Net Worth, Shareholder's Equity or just Equity)|**Balance Sheet**|Solvency: Ability for the company to pay its debts and going though.|**Net Equity** should grow regularly|
|**Income** (Sales) - **Expenses** = **Net Income** (also called Net Profit or Net Earnings)|**Income Statement**|Profitability|Positive (which can be used by the company for reinvesting, paying debts or in dividends)|

Where to find this data? The EDGAR database from SEC contains every listed company, along with their reports. The most important ones are **10K** and **10Q**. Remember to compare the values with the same moments during the year.

**10K reports**: annual and must include audited financial statements.**10Q reports**: quarterly and include unaudited financial statements.

EDGAR Database: [https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html](https://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html)

\---

2. Also, is essential to know what we are investing in. Stocks can be classified as:

|*Type of Stock*|*Description*|*What does it suppose?*|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Growth stock|When it grows faster and higher than the overall stock market.|**Better prospects** **for growth** in the immediate future but **more risk**|
|Value stock|When is priced lower than the value of the company and its assets.|**Steadier growth** over a longer term, but have **less risk**|

You may ask yourself, which stock is better. After all, **both**. Seek solid, value-oriented companies in growing industries. Value-oriented approaches to growth investing are the best, imo. Analyze the company fundamentals, seek value when you are buying and analyze the company's prospect to grow. On the other side, in the case of growth-stocks, buy only if it makes a profit and if you understand how it makes that profit and from where it generates sales.

\--

# Doing your own DD

&amp;#x200B;

|**Previous Steps**|
|:-|


The question we all do ourselves: How to choose a winning stock? Let's start answering first some questions:

1. You never start looking to the stock tables, **you finish there.**

Start informing yourself about the environment (technology, politics, economics, demographics...) and choose an **industry** that, you believe, will benefit. Example: Audi will stop manufacturing combustion cars by 2030 and focus on electric mobility; Company X partners with Nvidia to open a R&amp;D center for DL; Hospital X makes the first successful operation with a surgical robot brand XYZ. You know what I am talking about.

2. Once you have an industry, we can start looking for companies.

The tedious work. Only golden rule: Do. Not. Trust. only one source. Get multiple views, search, search and search, and don't base your investment on just one comment/article/opinion. This should be obvious, but we all (included me) have made this mistake.

3. Have a company? Let's start crossing points in the checklist.

Now it comes the serious business. For a noob like me, when I started reading and researching on my own, I couldn't imagine the diversity of opinions and different strategies out there when analyzing the value of a stock. In fact, I was surprised to see so many people though that is virtually impossible to  get ahead of the market, since a company's real value is and will be always reflected by its current stock price, and nowadays, news (and therefore, the economy) travel so fast that every time something (good or bad) happens for a company, it will be already reflected in the stock. In the end, there are many, multiple variables that affect the price. Not only technical - you have hype, hedge funds, market manipulation, and other thousand factors that I neither understand nor have any control over.

In the end I came to the conclusion that one has to fight with one's own weapons. Obviously, you're never going to outperform an investor who works 10 hours a day, but you don't need to be one either. In the same way that you don't need to be a professional cook to make a fucking good lasagna.

Assuming that the lottery of timing the market is almost impossible, we can still do (a lot) of things. Choosing a good, healthy, growing company will be always a much better bet. At least, doing this, you will be sure that there is a reasoning for your investment, you will be more confident, you will follow up much more close the news related to that company/industry, and above at all, you will have more **PATIENCE** to hold and ending up seeing green numbers.

&amp;#x200B;

|**First Filter**|
|:-|


You want a company that gives you a ""**yes""** for the following questions:

|Is the company making more **Net Income** (Sales - Expenses) than it did last year?|You want to invest in growing companies.|
|:-|:-|
|Are the company's **sales** greater than they were the year before?|The company needs to make money so you can make money too.|
|Is the company issuing **press releases** on new products, services, inventions or business deals?|You want to invest in a ""living"" company.|

&amp;#x200B;

|**Second Filter**|
|:-|


Are you happy so far? If so, let's go deeper into the details. To do this, follow a simple rule: **The 10's rule.**  From now own, you are gonna compare values with respect to the previous one, two or three years, and see how the change is.  You want to have a company that, ideally, improves with a magnitude of **10%** compared to the previous year.

*Note: Go to the table at the beginning if you need to remember each term and where to find it.*

* **Balance Sheet**
   * Total Assets: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Total Liabilities (what you own, debt): Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Equity: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
* **Income Statement:**
   * Sales (Total Revenue): Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?
   * Expenses: Has it decreased in the last years? If yes, how much?
   * Net Income: Has it grown in the last years? If yes, how much exactly?

Here you need to make some numbers. Just make an Excel where you can put the values for each year, do the math and see if is actually improving. Did you get a ""**yes**"" for every question? Or even better, almost 10% of improvement some of them? Then we continue:

&amp;#x200B;

|**Third Filter**|
|:-|


Let's see the **ROE** (Return on equity). It is a measure of financial performance calculated by dividing the **Net Income** by **Net Equity**. Because the **Net Equity** is equal to a company’s assets minus its liabilities (debt), the **ROE** is considered the return on net assets. ROE is a **measure of the profitability of a corporation.**

How much should the ROE be? Exactly, around **+10%** with respect to the previous year. That would mean that the company is in good hands.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fourth Filter**|
|:-|


**EPS (Earnings per Share)**: This is calculated as the company's **earnings** divided by the outstanding number of shares. In other words, it indicates **how much money the company makes for each share of its stock**. It is normally used to estimate its corporate value.

A higher EPS means greater value, as the company has higher profits relative to the share price.

**P/R Ratio (Price/Earnings)**: Now, take the price of one share and divide it by the previous EPS. This is the P/E Ratio. In other words, i**t indicates how much you can expect to invest in order to receive one dollar of that's company's earnings.** In other sentence, it tells how much investors are willing to pay for one dollar of earnings. Example: If the P/E is 20, then the investor is willing to pay $20 for $1 of earnings. All these, gives you an idea about if the company is **over-** or **under-valued**.

A higher P/E Ratio (caused by high stock price and/or low earnings) suggest that investors **expect higher earnings growth** in the future (although it may have low earnings), even if that means it is **over-valued**.

A low P/E Ratio (caused by low stock price and/or high earnings) indicates that the company might be **undervalued** and/or that the company **is actually doing pretty well** (high earnings given a low stock price). In this last case, it could mean that you are looking at something worth paying attention to.

When the P/E is N/A, the company does not have earnings or is in loss.

Compare always this ratios with peer companies in the **same industry group** to have a reference or the P/E of that market itself (e.g. S&amp;P 500 P/E Ratio is 15 more or less). In general terms, for the P/E ratio you can expect the following:

* P/E = **N/A** : No earnings / in loss.
* P/E = **1-15** : The company's value should be more compared to its earnings (under-valued) OR there is less sentiment regarding growth. They are **less risky** investments.
* P/E = **15 - 20** :  Normal value, according to the growth of the market.
* P/E &gt;= **20** : The company's value should be less compared to its earnings (over-valued) OR there is a high sentiment regarding growth. They are **more risky** investments.

Are you a **value-stock** investor? Look for a P/E between 10 and 25. More oriented to **growth-stocks**? Get higher. But remember, higher the P/E Ratio, higher the risk.

&amp;#x200B;

|**Fifth Filter**|
|:-|


Keep doing research! This was just a extremely simple guide. Do you find a parameter that you don't have a clue what does it means, and is very different compared to a peer company? Search what it means!

It's difficult to be sure when you should invest in the stock, but if you follow the previous steps, at least you will now that you did your job. You can even make an excel where you feel comfortable. Import the data to have all the info at once so you can know if the company is worth investing. And above all, have patience. You are in this game for many years.

I am not certain, but I believe it is very likely that it will happen.

For me, I think we’re going towards an era of higher inflation, which was highly affected by the pandemic that has now brought about increasing vaccination rates, less business restrictions, pandemic relief programs and consumer savings.

Are you willing to trade in fake monopoly money?

If the answer to these questions are yes, do I have a stock for you! Introducing Canada's shittiest telecom company, Bell Canada! Ticker: BCE.TO

**The Pitch**

If you ever found yourself thinking: ""What if EA was a telecom company?"" you found it, my guy. This company has tech support and pricing options that has EA execs taking notes, alongside *exemplary* customer service. 

And then there's this: Bell is currently rolling out 5G service to Canada - the first of the big three shitstorm telecom companies in the Great White North to do so. 

The company has trememdous upside. Don't believe me? Let's see the fundamentals.

**The Fundamentals**

No one asked. Moving on.

**Charts No One Reads**

Look at this graph!

Those were cool, I guess. I can't read but maybe someone can translate.

**Current Events**

Conspiracy theorists claim that the government is putting 5G microchips into people &gt;!(instead of tracking, oh, I dunno, the phone that you should probably stop using as a vibrating butt plug) !&lt;and guess which company has the most to gain from the recent crisis? Why, Bell Canada of course. Imagine the possibilities! Instead of forcing Canadians to pay obscene amounts for data, now they can charge microtransactions on your life! Because no telecom company is giving us 5G anything for free, you fucking idiots. 

**Verdict**

While the stock doesn't quite go vertical like the flashy tech stocks that you all know, love, and ram down our throats, it pays 1.5% of its value as a dividend every quarter. And I just think that's neat.",2021-07-10 15:46:32,CraZCanuck

1038,A practical template for understanding and trading bear market moves.,16.0,"Greetings, WSB. A month ago I gave you some insight into how small my penis is by sharing my template of [broad bear market moves, based on 100 yrs of bear markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).  In this post I'll further display my boyhood by getting to the specific swings and trades I tend to find in a bear market move.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's the template we're going to be using. I first published this on Reddit about 3 months ago.

https://preview.redd.it/2bs04lwcvea71.png?width=1739&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=7493123ffd878d481eae9796c6bc34bd1347a620

To display and assess the usefulness of this, we'll start looking at some super long term examples. Hindsight porn.  Move into some more recent examples where I can show you my real time forecasts on the moves as they were posted and then we'll round it off giving some forward looking examples so you can tell me how fucking stupid I am if they don't work out.

We used the same basic structure [in the last post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/), leaving the forward looking forecast that AMC would be rejected and begin to fall off of the 60 level.

&amp;#x200B;

We'll kick things off with everyone's favourite car stock, Ford (This statement would have been true at some point in history...)

https://preview.redd.it/vnp252x0wea71.png?width=1727&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2fb5b64df0a3771188f26ae19169156cbfb4df41

So up until about 2000 F was a stonk! Rockets and stuff. And then it started to go tits up. Making money in the rockets part is easy, but let's focus on how to make money or at least retain your profits while the tits are on the rise and the price is on the slump.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/y6aaph1kwea71.png?width=1706&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=8289ac6279861204f5a1e24b365c5f4e40cba393

Pretty simple. The decline breaks down into 5 major swings.  Quite easy to see these after the fact if you know to look for them and once you've found where we are in the cycle it's then pretty easy to apply forward looking trade plans.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

GME

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I know we're not allowed to talk about GME as if is was just another stock because (All the reasons) - so just for fun we'll hypothetically say it is just like another stock since it did just to exactly the fucking same thing as the others do.

Then it went into the next stages of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

Let's get up to recent times.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's an [analysis posted during last week on ARKK](https://www.reddit.com/user/HoleyProfit/comments/of9mw8/ark_possible_stages_of_downtrend/) (I like to think they call it ARKK because they take in 2 of everything going extinct).

https://preview.redd.it/wda13912yea71.png?width=1715&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=566e1a2a1a247f9083b7a752482f980dea7be528

The real move in ARKK would develop over the next two trading days (Using a line chart here since the market gapped, it let's you better see the swings. Gapping markets are usually best read as one big price swing and a line chart will show you that).

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/muimcjtayea71.png?width=1694&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=faec6519c2f8e9b548fe1f36483d1c8f8fc0800c

After we got into the first bounce area, we transition into the bullish section of the move.

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qsbq2z0lyea71.png?width=1711&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2bcb5ba4bd0b9ce84968c8a4738ce5973cac14a8

Which again is showing the main stages marked out.

&amp;#x200B;

For our forward looking analysis, we'll link it in with the [AMC forecast from the first post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ny8u84/all_crashes_are_similar_only_perceptions_change/).

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my most recent post on AMC.

https://preview.redd.it/2uu0xrx4zea71.png?width=1716&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d04746919195241f56508fe898cf2dda3d8ca2bc

my thoughts here is at the time I posted this AMC was somewhere in this section of the move.

https://preview.redd.it/d6bw8wk9zea71.png?width=1010&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6af8623de7ce58e259c1472b73fb5f3fea5425dd

That we should look for the warning signs of the first drop and first pullback turning into the real break and then the solid fall.  I'll sync this nearer term analysis with my overall AMC analysis mentioned in the last post and this re-enforces my initial forecast;

&amp;#x200B;

&gt;...Would give us a projection of price getting to at least 17.50.

&amp;#x200B;

AMC closed the week at 46.  So that'd be quite a considerable way down for it to go yet.

1039,Critical Value Theory: Why Virgin Galactic (SPCE) is at bare minimum a $100 Billion company + Monday price prediction,93.0,"In this DD, I will attempt to prove through overwhelming evidence, historical trends,  market valuation, exponential growth, and more. That Virgin Galactic is criminally undervalued and is truly valued with other big name “potential stocks” while being historically comparable to the commercialization of the plane.


1. What is Virgin Galactic?


Virgin Galactic is an aerospace company that provides human spaceflight for private individuals and researchers. The company is focused on developing a spaceflight system to offer customers a multi-day experience culminating in a spaceflight that includes several minutes of weightlessness and views of earth from space. 

Easily summarized by themselves on their website saying their mission is

“to be the Spaceline for Earth, means we focus on using space for good while delivering an unparalleled customer experience”

They are a company attempting to commercialize space travel for the average person to be able to enjoy a trip to space.

This, by itself doesn’t give the company any value. Due to the unknown factors and ambitcious nature of this mission statement, it is understandable why investors would roll their eyes at the idea of this company and therefore making it not very valuable. 

However, due to the way Virgin Galactic is conducting itself and the way it presents itself as the first real attempt at making a commercial space traveling company, I believe this company has the potential to become one of the biggest travel line stocks in the world.


2. The market’s value system


Lets say hypothetically, within a certain sector, there was a subsection that only accounted for roughly 2% of the overall sector, and company A contributed 79% to said subsection. 

Now, it would be logical to assume that even though company A controls 79% of its subsection, it wouldn’t be a big player, as it’s entire subsection consists of only 2% of the overall sector. 

But what if I told you, that company A was in fact the largest company in its entire sector at a current market cap of 632 Billion dollars, and the runner up Company B, accounting for roughly 10% of all sells in the entire sector only had a current market cap of 248 Billion dollars.

As I’m sure you’ve guessed by now, this isn’t hypothetical. Company B is Toyota and Company A is Tesla.

Tesla. A company that controls a small subsection in the overall car market, has extremely low sale compared to other car manufacturers, and has never turned a profit off selling cars is over 2 times more valuable then the next runner up. Why?

While you could ague it’s valuation a hundred different ways from retail interest to the overall Bull market. Simply put, Tesla is valued so highly for 1 major reason. Their potential.

You can debate whether or not it’s rational, but it’s safe to say the market right now values a company primarily on its sector’s projected growth and the company’s own potential.

While Tesla is the most drastic example, almost all the big technology companies are valued similarly. 

Apple is the largest company in the world because of the belief in their potential to continuously innovate in news ways that drastically change their entire sector. 

Amazon is almost universal rated a buy by most top analysts due to the potential they have in becoming a modern monopoly.

Modern Criteria Value, is based not necessarily on current fundamentals and value, but the perceived potential a company has to grow within its sector.


3. Virgin Galactic’s exponential potential

On January 1st, 1914 the first ever commercial plane flew from St. Petersburg, Florida to Tampa, Florida. While not realized much at the time, this one flight would led to the creation 
of the multi trillion dollar industry that is modern day airlines.

And now, with interest in space travel at an all time high, and test flights like the one this upcoming Sunday making it more of a reality, one has to ask. 

What’s stopping history from repeating itself, and what will happen when investors realize this exponential market Space itself could potentially become. As Virgin Galactic push’s to make itself the number one most valuable space company, past private companies like SpaceX (with a market cap estimated to be 75 billion), the potential in this extremely lucrative future market will soon be realized by investors as they continue to look for huge potential stocks.




As far as Monday’s flight is concerned, how successful it is and the announcement afterwards are secondary for Monday’s price.

The main determinant in Monday’s price action will be how Virgin Galactic’s flight is portrayed by the media.

If it is portrayed poorly, or average. We will most likely see a rough sell off.

However, I personally believe will see an image of hope and excitement painted, As the media proclaims this to be a great leap for humanity as a whole (over exaggerating for attention).

In this case, we will see a massive run on Monday, with consolidation later in the week followed by more soaring.

1044,The Housing Market Is Not In A Bubble: Popping the Hopium Bubble,3.0,"Alright, so I have recently seen an uptick in stupidity regarding the housing market, and I have finally had enough. I am going to explain, clearly, why people are dumb for waiting in this housing market. I am also going to eviscerate the half-assed due diligence that has, lately, been put forward and which has compounded people’s wildly speculative hope about the housing market going “down”.

To be “constructive,” I’ve written up how you CAN purchase a house if you don’t have a leg up for cheaper than you initially might have if you didn’t follow the instruction manual. 

CH 1. The History Lesson: The Past Informs the Future

From the moment one is born, there are overarching needs that must be fulfilled to survive. Things that you need to survive, as opposed to wanting. When one looks at their needs, versus their wants, it is imperative to look at Maslow’s hierarchy of needs. A baby needs their physiological needs met or they will die, and this does not change as you grow into adulthood. These are your **foundational** needs, from which everything else can grow. You need food, water, sleep, and **shelter**. 

“The land is the only thing in the world worth working for, worth fighting for, worth dying for, because it's the only thing that lasts"".....Gerald O'Hara, Gone With The Wind.”

Land is a finite resource, and land in desirable areas are even more so. While population density in areas ebb and flow, this principle largely holds true as a rule of thumb. However, this is not a function of only the finiteness of land, but of the conceptual theory of ownership. Common land or property refers to land or property that is completely open for access, such as a public park freely available to everyone. Even though there are some restrictions to this common land, the fundamental property is for enjoyment by all and held in common trust. On the other hand, when an individual or small unit owns land, they hold the sole right to use and enjoy that land. If I may be so bold as to make a Dumas pun, common land is “One for all,” and Private Land is “All for one.” 

With that said, let us zoom forward and take an overhead view of the 2008 crisis. After all, the “house of cards” fell apart for land, didn’t it? No, what fell apart was human hubris my dearest reader. For, you see, land and property are not irrational. Humans are. In the years leading to 2008, and 2008 itself, there were numerous failed safeguards which lead to the collapse of property prices. In fact, I argue that the Bush Administration intentionally under regulated the mortgage industry in the hopes of boosting homeownership rates.

The first was the fact that people were being approved for loans with no down payments, which meant they had **no skin in the game** if property values went down. The second reason was that income verification was nonexistent. Finally ARM loans, otherwise known as adjustable-rate mortgages, were huge back then, and banks would push these loans in addition to no down payment loans. Therefore, a mortgage payment that was at one point 200 could skyrocket to 800 a month (and to be clear, these were mostly interest payments and not principal payments). As you can imagine, most of these loans went to people of color or low-income families. Finally, these shitty loans were coupled with genuinely good loans, and packaged into investment products known as **mortgage-backed securities** with an A rating (misleading, to say the least).  Combine that with the fact that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were not federally backed at the time, and you get a recipe for disaster when the Great Recession hits. 

After all, when you have no equity in your home, and you are suddenly underwater… There is no reason to stay is there?

Ch 2. The Present Is a Function of The Past

Now that we have explained why there was a crash in 2008, we can clarify why today is different. The first reason, and the simplest, is that homebuilders were scarred after 2008 and have persistently underbuilt. The conservative estimate is that we have a home inventory shortage of 3.8M homes, and it will take years (if not almost a decade) to rectify. 

Household formations are also increasing significantly as the largest population group (millennials) are aging into their prime home buying years. This will continue for, at least, the next five years. There is ongoing, additional, demand for an additional 1.2M homes a year and this does not cut into account the severe shortage right now. Homebuilding starts sit at around 1.577M a year at a seasonally adjusted rate for May which is the latest reported data.[\[1\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn1) Building Permits stand at around 1.681M. That means homebuilders are only decreasing the deficit by roughly 377K homes this year if things stay as, they have been. 

So, let us go with a hypothetical. Say there are ten people who do not have a home but have money and want to buy one. However, there are only homes for three people available. 10 people are fighting for three homes, which means that the demand significantly outweighs the supply. Hence, bidding wars start. Then, to add to this conundrum, in the next year 1.2 people are added to the list of people who are looking to buy a home. So, there are 11.2 people now looking for a home, but home supply has only increased to 4.4. So, while supply has increased, slightly, relative to demand it is quite slight. 

  To add to this, a not statistically insignificant portion of people have left higher cost of living areas to live elsewhere due to the work from home trend. These people either owned, and sold, their homes in said higher cost of living area or… They had saved up to buy a home in a higher cost of living area. When they move to a lower cost of living area, they are therefore able to considerably outbid others since they have a much higher cash hoard. They are also fine on a net-net basis if they had sold their home in a higher cost of living area because they sold their home for above asking price (most likely). Additionally, these people spent less and were likely beneficiaries of the stock market. 

&amp;#x200B;

These people, by virtue of paying all cash, cannot go “underwater” on their home loans. There will be no crash for these people. Furthermore, underwriting standards and income verification standards are much stricter for debt-to-income ratio, down payments, and the income verification. So, people who get a mortgage to purchase a home will always have skin in the game. A low interest rate on mortgages will also mean you can purchase more home, for the same fixed mortgage payment. When I say fixed mortgage payment, I mean to say that most home loans are now fixed, which means that you now have no unpleasant surprises if interest rates rise. 

Ch 3. The Great Mortgage Originator War Is Keep Rates Low, with Continued Home Appreciation

Congratulations, you got this far. So, you want to know why people can buy so much house? Well, that is partly a function of the Fed purchasing a lot of mortgage-backed securities and treasuries, as well as strong bond purchases. This has kept mortgage rates at roughly or a little below 3% for months now. 

With that said, the two largest mortgage originators have also been on a volume war and squeezing the wholesale mortgage market (which is highly fragmented) in the process. For the last month and a half, the largest wholesale lender (United Wholesale Mortgage) has been price matching 15 competitors.[\[2\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn2) Rocket, in the meantime has made it’s “Broker Freedom Credit,” which gives a 50bps discount permanent.[\[3\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn3) While RKT and UWMC do not directly compete due to United Wholesale Mortgage’s ultimatum to its brokers that if they work with RKT they cannot work with UWMC, the aggressive push for market share in this fragmented space means that margin compression will remain for a while. A pessimistic Jeffries report believes that normalization to normal gain on sale margins of roughly 150 BPS will not happen until sometime in 2023. 

This means rates will continue to be strong for consumers as they purchase homes for awhile yet, meaning you are doing yourselves no favors by sitting on the sidelines. 

To add to this, home price appreciation for 2022 is expected to moderate but still be strong. Home prices in 2022 are expected to rise by roughly 4.4% in a forecast by Freddie Mac. CoreLogic, a property data and analytics company, expects home prices to increase by 3.5%.[\[4\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn4)

Ch 4. Government Policies to Help Prospective Homeowners

First the FHA is taking steps to help remove barriers to homeownership for those with student loan debt. I am going to quote the relevant portion from the announcement: “The policy updates published on Thursday evening for FHA Single Family Title II forward mortgages remove the current requirement that lenders calculate a borrower’s student loan monthly payment of one percent of the outstanding student loan balance for student loans that are not fully amortizing or are not in repayment. The new policy bases the monthly payment on the actual student loan payment, which is often lower, and helps home buyers who, with student debt, meet minimum eligibility requirements for an FHA-insured mortgage.”[\[5\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn5)

Secondly, with the supreme court’s decision which paved the way for Mark Calabria’s removal by President Joe Biden, there is a very significant chance that the adverse market fee which he had implemented will be removed. This added roughly 1,400 in costs to the average home borrower, which will likely no longer apply sooner rather than later.[\[6\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn6)

Finally, “Starting on June 5, Fannie Mae will offer a product called Refi Now. Freddie Mac’s version, called Refi Possible, is set to launch on August 30. Borrowers with loans backed by Fannie or Freddie and who make 80% or less than their area’s median household income will qualify… The programs aim to expand refi access by lowering costs and loosening some eligibility requirements. For example, borrowers can qualify for a reduced interest rate with a credit score as low as 620 and a debt-to-income ratio as high as 65%.

&amp;#x200B;

The FHFA estimates that qualifying homeowners could save between $1,200 and $3,000 a year — or an average of $100 to $250 each month.”[\[7\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn7)

Ch 5. Forbearances are not the Armageddon.

As of June 25, the forbearance rate fell below 4% for the first time in a year. There are still an estimated 2M homeowners who have a loan in forbearance, but forbearance exits picking up could mean that the U.S. economy is on its way to doing better.[\[8\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn8) The Biden Administration has also extended the eviction moratorium and to enter forbearance through to the end of July, which the S.C. has permitted.[\[9\]](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/submit#_ftn9)

The reason it did so is to allow rent relief to continue working its way down to landlords, as it has been bogged down in bureaucracy. This should mean that the impact on small time landlords will be alleviated and mute the impact of homes sold due to necessity by these small-time landlords. 

In the words of Brett Kavanaugh: "" those few weeks will allow for additional and more orderly distribution of the congressionally appropriated rental assistance funds.""

Chapter 6. Owning is (almost) always better than Renting.  


1. Rent increases with inflation. Your mortgage will, however, even if 25 years pass.

2. Rent (unless you live in a VHCOL area) must account for the mortgage payment, homeowner insurance, HOA/Property Taxes, etcetera. As a result, it is significantly higher than a mortgage payment. And still make profit Better to buy less house now and use those savings to buy more house later. 

3. You increase your own equity with every mortgage payment you make. 

4. You get beneficial tax advantages, especially if you decide to rent it out when you move out later in life. 

5. The only time I would not own is if when I rented out the house, I couldn’t cover all the expenses and make a profit under the 1% or 2% rule. In those cases, it’s better to just keep your money in the stock market and look for a job elsewhere. If you work at a place like McDonalds where the minimum wage is 15, and you live in NYC. I am sorry, you are not getting a house. Move to W. Va if you want one since the cost of living is significantly cheaper there, but the wage there at McDonalds is still 15 dollars. It sucks, but it is what it is. 

Ch. 6. What you can do to Buy a Home

1. Step 1: Find home purchase assistance from your local and state government. A lot of states have this, including loan assistance with low or no interest. For example, Delaware County in PA has a Homeownership First Program which offers “down payment and closing cost assistance to eligible homebuyers. The total assistance is not to exceed 5,000; this will cover up to 2 percent of the down payment of the new home.” Pennsylvania Housing Finance Agency also aids through a variety of programs, one of which is the HOMEstead Down payment and Closing Cost Assistance Loan. According to the PHPA: “The program provides homebuyers with up to $10,000 (and a minimum of $1,000) in down payment and closing cost assistance in the form of a no-interest, second mortgage loan. HOMEstead funds are forgiven at 20 percent per year over five. The first mortgage is provided by PHFA at the same rate as the Keystone Home Loan program.” 

2. Find a home that has a lower price than comparably priced homes in the neighborhood that have the same format. The reason for this could be due to bad landscaping, mismatching flooring (mixture of carpet floors and hardwood floors), terrible paintjobs, termites eating at the shingles of the roof, etcetera. You basically want to find wedge deals where the cost to fix is significantly lower than the home price appreciation by doing these fixes. There is a certain youtuber who makes a killing on this. The principle is like this: 1) Homes in the neighborhood with your potential home’s configuration run at around 220K, but 2) The home you are buying is selling for 150K because of fixes that it needs for any of the things listed above. 3) The cost to improve the home runs around 5-20K, which then brings your home’s value to that of your neighbors (look up what entry level things you need to do to make it an entry level home. Again, there is a youtuber for that). 4) This leaves you “extra” cash to outbid, if need be, up to whatever it is to be equal. Once you “fix up” the home, have it reappraised by the bank so that your new equity is in the house plus however much you now have in addition. This is even better if you turn this into a rental afterwards when you move to your second home. Remember to make sure that everything you buy is entry level, so you can rent it out if it makes sense to rent it out later. 

3. If you need a move in ready home, get home configurations that see a lot less interest like 2 Bedroom homes, with 2 baths, etcetera. If you have two kids that are on the younger side, you can get a bunk bed for them, and they can sleep in the same room for a year or three while you build up the equity in your home and then “move up” in 5 years. 

4. Buy in a less desirable area, but with a low level of crime, then work your way up while building equity in your home. 

5. Remember that rental properties count as income for (last I checked???) 80 percent of the rental income. If you have bought a wedge property, and then reappraised, you also likely removed PMI. 

6. Remember that if you are buying a fixer upper to turn it into a rental, or a less desirable house there is less competition, and the competition you have is more likely rational as they are investors. For example, a buyer of a home who is an investor that wants to flip it must account for the 6% real estate commission cost when he flips it. 

7. Alternatively, just buy a new home from one of the large home builders and realize cost savings elsewhere, to be frank. 

The End (Or Out to Lunch)

I think the cruise industry is poised for a breakout. COVID is still not over across the globe, but it has slowed down considerably within the US. Over the next two years, demand is going to surge back up. People are willing to fly and spend extra to get away, which will most likely also translate to cruise companies. The future for cruising is also bright. Airlines are going to have significant worries about fuel prices and changing their fleets to electric aircraft. So far, airplanes of comparable capacity and range do not exist in electric form. As for the cruise ships, there is already hybrid technology, literally sailing, and the potential for nuclear power. The only negatives here for CCL is they are holding a lot of debt from the pandemic. Their profitability ratios aren't great for their industry either. Nevertheless, I think the future looks bright for CCL.

1050,Canopy Growth Corp – a sleeping weed giant,2.0,"Ok nerds, I’m high right now so be gentle. Also, I’m no expert and this is by no means financial advice, but I want to make a case for CGC as the best cannabis play right the fuck now. 

Of all the cannabis plays, Canopy appears to be the safest bet. With a strong partner in Constellation Brands (STZ), Canopy is already a leader in the space. If the U.S. gets serious about legalization, the speculators will pile back in and this will take off again. Unlike the last 2 run-ups, it would be in the midst of an improving cost structure, strengthening company fundamentals, new products (THC infused drinks), and even higher global interest in recreational cannabis. 

The last quarterly earnings report on 6/1 was a bit of a downer. The past two quarters, in fact, have been downers. There has been a lot of noise though, namely the company was in the process of optimizing operations (closed some facilities, reduced staff) to improve margins and lower costs. They have a strong balance sheet as they hold considerable cash (and equivalents), courtesy of investments from STZ.

**The History with Constellation Brands (STZ)**

Originally STZ purchased a \~10% stake in 2017. A year later, they tripled down and raised this to 38% with $4 billion (!). In early 2020 they exercised warrants to purchase even more, bringing their total stake to about **38.6%**. They are confident in this long term. 

Former STZ CFO was made CEO of Canopy in late 2019. The former CEO was fired and I believe this move has been good for the outlook of the company. New CEO David Klein is focused on cost control and taking the company to profitability. Unfortunately, that means the past 2 quarters have seen charges related to this and that produced larger losses than previous quarters and that shook some investors.  

**But Fuck Fundamentals, Lets Look at Magic Candlesticks**

As of Friday, the stock has traded down from the YTD daily close high of **$52.17** seen on 2/10/2021, all the way to **$22.15,** a more than **57% decline** in just **4 months** (oof!). This is way oversold. This chart I drew lines on proves I’m right:

[Magic Candlesticks](https://preview.redd.it/n9etitzwmfa71.png?width=2117&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=da6ec7d1d7c165c887850ec19d1ea6fa6259d3bb)

See, the price tanked after what I believe was a bit of an artificial spike in February (this was around the time all shorted, high spec stocks saw panic buying). There wasn’t any good news to follow, and as mentioned, the quarterly reports were dog shit so that was fuel for the downtrend since.

But the stock has found support in the low $20’s and has been consolidating for six weeks now. The Relative Strength Index (bottom most indicator) came very close to dropping below 30 (technically oversold) but instead hooked up on Friday. The market blip on Thursday shook some people out, but the stock held the support level. We’re at the bottom of this consolidation channel, in my opinion. Volume on Friday was lighter than I would have liked to see to confirm this, so we need to see what Monday and Tuesday look like before getting aggressive.

The next earnings report should be in early August, so we’re about 3 weeks out. I suspect we’ll see a climb back towards $25, at a minimum, prior to that report. Note the volume-by-price bars on the right of the chart. The green line (point of control) marks a potential resistance area. This sits right at \~$25.45 or so.

If this quarter is better than the last 2, we’re going over $25. There is reason to believe it will be, given we should be past the bulk of the cost associated with optimization, and the THC infused drinks seem to be popular. They've also done very well with roll-outs of CBD based products, which they can already sell in the U.S. through various partnerships. 

And finally, if Congress stops dicking around and starts talking cannabis reform again, we could move back into the $40’s by year-end. Breaking that $25.45 level would be key.

Also, seasonality is interesting for Canopy – it has done **much** better in October-&gt;January over the past five years. I’m taking my position now since I don’t see this breaking below the current support channel, but a more cautious approach would be to wait until this next quarterly report before taking a position. Like I said, I’m not a financial expert and this isn’t investment advice so do your own research and good luck! 

**Disclosure**: I’m holding (and plan to hold &gt;1yr):

* **Jan 21 2022 $45c** 
* **800 shares**

Depending on the next earnings report, I may add to these.

**TL/DR** $CGC 30c 1/21/2022 or shares, because CGC is undervalued and the price seems to have bottomed

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qa4gd7muc7a71.png?width=700&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=34538a36b5835417e5fc7ccd8641fa9d0a188abe

**SoFi Technologies (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**SOFI**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast)**)**

SoFi (or Social Finance) was founded in 2011 and is a fintech, or financial technology company, that offers a suite of financial products through its platform, a one-stop-shop app. The company’s three major business segments include lending, a technology platform, and financial services.

SoFi’s lending services include student loan refinancing, personal and home loans, while its technology platform, Galileo, provides services, including an authorization application programming interface (API) to financial and non-financial institutions.

The company’s financial services include insurance services under SoFi Protect, a SoFi Credit Card, and Lantern Credit, a financial services marketplace.

Last month, SoFi Technologies made its debut on the Nasdaq as an independent company, following its SPAC merger with blank check company Social Capital Hedosophia.

In Q1, the company posted adjusted net revenues of $216 million, while the company had guided for revenues ranging between $190 million and $195 million. SoFi reported adjusted EBITDA of $4 million, and ended the quarter with 2,281 thousand members, a jump of 110% year-over-year.

On June 28, SoFi’s lock-up period expired. The lock-up period is the length of time after the company goes public when early employees or shareholders in the company may not sell their shares. This time period can vary between 90 to 180 days.

Following the expiry of the lock-up period, Rosenblatt Securities analyst [Sean Horgan](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/sean-horgan) reiterated a Buy and a price target of $30 (65.9% upside) on the stock. The analyst saw “a unique buying opportunity as a result of this recent selling and ahead of a potentially significant upside catalyst (bank charter approval).”

In October last year, SoFi received preliminary conditional approval from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in the United States regarding its application for a national bank charter. However, this application will still need to be reviewed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and the Federal Reserve. (See [SoFi Technologies stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Analyst Horgan expects the process for approval of the bank charter to conclude by the end of this year, adding an upside of more than 25% to the analyst’s EBITDA estimates.

The analyst said in a note to investors, “All the catalysts we expect (in order of magnitude) are: 1) SOFI's bank charter approval/denial (expected 2021); 2) lockup period ends (June 28), employee trading restrictions expire (post-earnings, expected mid-August), senior leadership lockup expiration (Late December); 3) federal student loan forbearance period expiration (currently set for October 1, 2021); 4) rising interest rates.”

However, Horgan noted that a regulation that could allow for a four-year college course without paying any tuition fees could pose “a substantial downside to SOFI's core student lending business, which we believe is a low-single-digit probability risk.”

The analyst believes that students enrolled in four-year undergraduate programs make up the “largest piece of SOFI's student lending revenues and market opportunity.” In Q1, SoFi’s lending segment had student loan originations worth $1,468 million.

Horgan also believes that a rise in regulatory scrutiny when it comes to payment for order flow (PFOF) regulations should not concern SoFi shareholders as “its revenue exposure from its brokerage business is insignificant (&lt;1% of 2020 revenues) in comparison to many retail brokers.” PFOF is the compensation a brokerage firm receives for directing orders to other parties to execute trades.

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Moderate Buy based on 2 Buys. The average [SoFi Technologies price target of $27.50](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/sofi/forecast) implies approximately 52.1% upside potential to current levels.

**Upstart Holdings (**[**NASDAQ**](https://www.tipranks.com/index/nasdaq-100)**:** [**UPST**](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast)**)**

Upstart Holdings is a cloud-based artificial intelligence (AI) lending platform that connects consumers to its network of AI-enabled bank partners for loans. The company generates revenues primarily through fees paid by banks.

The company charges referral fees to banks for every loan referred through the Upstart.com website and originated by a bank partner. UPST also charges a platform fee for every loan origination, regardless of its source, and servicing fees for loans as consumers repay them.

UPST helps consumers receive personal loans by connecting them to its bank and credit union partners. It uses variables like employment and education to predict a consumer’s creditworthiness.

Last month, the company entered into a partnership with workflow application programming interface (API) connectivity provider NXTsoft to enable Upstart to streamline the implementation of its platform to financial institutions in the U.S.

In Q1, UPST reported total revenues of $121.3 million, a jump of 90% year-over-year that surpassed the Street’s estimates of $116.1 million. The company’s adjusted earnings ballooned 340% year-over-year to $0.22 per share in Q1, topping consensus estimates of $0.15 per share.

Upstart Holdings has projected total revenue to land between $150 million and $160 million in Q2. For 2021, the company increased its revenue expectations to approximately $600 million versus the prior guidance of $500 million. (See [Upstart Holdings stock chart](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/stock-charts) on TipRanks)

Following the Q1 earnings, Jeffries analyst [John Hecht](https://www.tipranks.com/analysts/john-hecht) reiterated a Buy and raised the price target from $81 to $101 (16.7% downside) on the stock. Hecht remained upbeat about the stock following strong growth trends and the company’s Prodigy acquisition.

On March 15, the company announced the acquisition of Prodigy Software, a provider of cloud-based automotive retail software, for $100 million.

In Q1, Upstart’s bank partners originated 169,750 loans worth $1.73 billion across the company’s platform, an increase of 102% year-over-year. The conversion rate was 22% on rate requests, up 14% year-over-year.

Analyst Hecht stated, “…the strong loan count and improving conversion rate highlight strong growth trends as '21 progresses, with UPST's AI lending platform continuing to perform well.”

The analyst noted that the company’s Q2 revenue guidance “represents \~30% upside from our prior ests. \[estimates\] at the midpoint.”

He continued on a positive note, saying, “We continue to believe Upstart's cloudbased, Artificial Intelligence (AI) lending platform results in a superior credit product with attractive economics for both consumers and lenders, a 'win-win' model for both participants. We see LT \[long term\], strong growth opportunities given a first-mover advantage and a very large TAM \[total addressable market\].”

Consensus among analysts on Wall Street is a Strong Buy based on 3 Buys and 1 Hold. The average [Upstart Holdings price target of $143.25](https://www.tipranks.com/stocks/upst/forecast) implies approximately 18.2% upside potential to current levels.

 **Bottom Line**

It is important to note here that while SoFi is functioning as an online bank with a variety of financial products available through its app, Upstart offers personal and auto loans through its platform. It remains to be seen whether Upstart will expand its product offerings.

Upstart has stated in its company filing, “There is significant opportunity to expand from personal loans to auto loans, credit cards, mortgages, student loans, point-of-sale loans and home equity lines of credit (HELOC).”

While analysts are cautiously optimistic about SoFi, they are bullish on Upstart. Based on the upside potential over the next 12 months, SoFi seems to be a better Buy.

1074,$GGB huge potential,1.0,"So let me start off, Gerdau S.A. ($GGB) is a Brazilian steel company that operates in North America ( which is one of the largest recyclers and producers ), they also operate in Brazil, Argentina, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Mexico, Peru, Uruguay, Venezuela, Gerdau over all is the 30th largest steel maker it has 337 industrial and commercial units that produce over 26M metric tons of Steel per year, the steel is used in cars, buildings, and agricultural ventures. 

Currently imports on foreign steel is a huge issue for consumers and producers in the US as we are lacking the supply of steel to meet demands. This past week US producers and manufactures have been calling for the biden administration to end tariffs on foreign steel imports ( tariffs imposed by Trump, so we should see a end to tariffs as this admin hates Trump and everything he did.) 

Gerdau is environmentally alert they are cautious of how much carbon emissions they put out and what their factories do to wildlife/nature.

What Gerdau saw in this past quarter -

- Profits grew over 10 fold and revenues were up 77%, however steel production fell 1% and sales grew 15% to 3M tones 

- Production in Brazil rose 4% but fell 7% in North America, this however would turn around if Tarrifs were lifted on steel and steel component imports. 

- The brazilian exchange rate between USD and Reais is quite favorable for Gerdau and will continue to be with how much the US has spent on bonds and materials.

1078,Is There Still A Bullish Case For Spotify? Time Is Running Out.,19.0,"Let me start by saying that I love Spotify and have been using it for over seven years. Everything about the platform is great and like many others, I have no plans of switching. The algorithm is unlike anything I've experienced on a music streaming app and has helped me discover countless new artists and genres. I’m sure you have felt a similar experience. Unfortunately, none of these amazing features should allow an investor to turn a blind eye to an obscene valuation. As history has shown, Wall Street will eventually make you pay the price. People quickly forget that Pandora Media was one of the world’s leading internet radio providers before collapsing due to more competition, and eventually was bought by Sirius XM.

Growing Sales Doesn't Justify its High Valuation. Spotify is currently valued as a high-margin, wide-moat business. Investors are willing to pay a premium now for profits that aren't expected for at least four to five years. Bulls love to only focus on the impressive revenue and MAU growth, huge podcast signings, and overall great product. The question I always follow up and ask is, “How much more room is there to grow?”. Spotify has already absorbed close to 35% of the music streaming market as of 2019 and with a number of new platforms emerging each year, it’s only going to get more competitive. Some reports are claiming that Spotify’s share has declined closer to 30% as of 2020 but these are difficult to verify.

If Spotify can’t generate a profit now, when will they? Their explosive growth and exclusive content signings are costly and while it looks good in the near term, it doesn’t imply a sustainable business model. On top of that, Spotify’s high EV/EBITDA (can’t use profit margins since negative) imply it’s trading well above fair value vs. similar names such as Netflix, Sirius XM, or Apple.

Some may argue that it is unfair comparing a low/negative EBITDA with companies that have stronger multiples, but to me, that is the point I'm trying to make. Spotify doesn't deserve this valuation given its low-margin business. If management can prove to investors that it can scale AND improve operating margins, then it will deserve the valuations of Netflix and Apple who already have 18-25% net income margins. 

Royalty Fees Remain a Major Concern. One of the biggest things I feel Wall Street fails to effectively understand with Spotify is its painful royalty fee structure. 73-80% of the company's revenue is subject to this in a given year, and it isn't going anywhere. There are no economies of scale or optimization strategies that will fix this; it's a constant payment to recording owners such as Universal Music or Sony that eat up the vast majority of Spotify's revenue. Figure 3 shows Spotify’s unchanged gross margins for the last three years despite impressive top-line growth.

It's even more surprising when you find out that Spotify is one of the worst paying streaming services out there. There isn’t much more room for management to decrease payouts or else they risk losing more market share.

Why is that important you might ask? Well, one of the hottest topics in music streaming right now (has been for years) revolves around artists, who are demanding to be paid more and rightfully so. This does not bode well for Spotify’s low payout coupled with more streamers entering the market who will try to gain exclusive access from artists by paying them more. If Spotify decides to increase payouts to retain artists, it's only going to hurt their bottom line. 

Competition From Apple Music Will continue to be an issue for Spotify. Earlier this year, Apple unveiled its lossless streaming and spatial audio which is essentially a new enhanced way to listen to your favorite artists. It's a relatively new feature that launched in June and I believe as more people become aware of its better high-resolution stream offering, there is potential for them to take more market share from Spotify. I’m not claiming to be a music expert, but many blogs/articles are out there touting Apple’s achievement and we have yet to hear from Spotify on their next move. They may match what Apple has released, but until then, it has become a new near-term risk for Spotify. 

Don't Sleep on Spotify's Debt. Although Spotify currently generates a healthy operating cash flow, it's important to recognize the $1.8 billion in debt on its balance sheet. In early 2021, Spotify raised $1.3 billion in unsecured notes. For what exactly? Many are speculating on the uses. An acquisition? General corporate purposes? Paying out more to artists? That remains to be said, but regardless this adds a new risk factor to Spotify if it cannot execute on a plan to pay off these notes due in 2026. The company does have a history of getting out of a high debt situation. Prior to going public in 2018, Spotify had raised approximately $1 billion of convertible debt at a roughly $10 billion valuation with private investors before selling it off to Tencent for the direct listing. Kind of weird when you’re competitor owns a piece of your company after going public.

Spotify is a tricky business to evaluate. There aren't any fair comparables (I've seen research analysts use Netflix and Amazon for multiples) to accurately value it. So, what is a fair value for a company that can generate massive revenues, has a superior product, but can't make a profit? I'm a firm believer that investors eventually lose patience with a company that doesn't improve bottom-line margins. Does it take five years? Ten? After going public in mid-2018, Spotify traded range-bound between $105-200 per share and appeared to be fairly valued until April 2020 when it began to take off. In my opinion, this more than 100% increase to $350 per share was not justified given the company's inability to improve profit margins while management gave no indication that things were drastically changing. Some will argue that higher sales and improving MAU's played a role but that was already factored into the share price prior to the run-up. Even though Spotify's share price is down 28% from its February high, there is still room to fall. Don't catch a falling knife as this name heads back to the low-$100's where it belongs.",2021-07-09 23:22:53,jejakqmqm

1096,AMC July 9 Soft Technical Analysis,51.0,"Hello all,

Time for a AMC TA today! We've got 2 important price levels to keep in mind.

See [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi\_soft\_technical\_analysis/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ofh1ha/sofi_soft_technical_analysis/) for my SOFI technical TA.

I am applying my strategy as a day trader to see what our long term resistance and support levels are. I'm simply a day trader of three years that has consistently used standard deviations, RVI, and volume on a 6month and 1year time frame to determine my buy/sell areas on stocks, no matter whether I am swing trading or trading intraday. My current trading accuracy is 81%.

\-Easy Breakdown of Statistical Standard deviations - 68% of a stock's price range over a given time frame is within 1 statistical standard deviation (2 blue lines) of it's average/regression trend (middle line), 96% within two deviations (first upper and lower purple lines), and 99.7% within 3 deviations (upper and lower purple lines). Most importantly, these deviations also function as true support and resistance levels, with deviations, once crossed, becoming either the new resistance or new support level.

Here is the AMC One Year Chart -  [https://imgur.com/sn57BvU](https://imgur.com/sn57BvU)

Here is the AMC 6 Month Chart -  [https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn](https://imgur.com/LD9uZNn)

Here is today's Chart with the One year and 6 month Red Deviation support/resistance lines drawn in -  [https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD](https://imgur.com/dCEhJGD)

Today's price action and targets are pretty simple. For AMC to keep up its momentum, we need to stay above the +1deviation support level on the One Year Chart of $43.65 (upper blue line) which is also its dip buy price area. If we can hold support there, AMC needs to at least trade sideways and break up to our next resistance level of +1 Deviations on the 6 Month Chart of $53.91. That would be an extremely impressive move today as it would represent almost a full deviation swing over the last two days.

If bulls are somehow able to push us through our $53.91 Deviation Resistance, our next price target would be the One Year +2Deviation Resistance level of 58.78.

For the downside, should AMC break $43.65 area, we could see prices bounce off the 6 Month Regression Trend of $36.67.

I have included all these price levels on today's chart. Good luck everyone, make some money today!

Here's a quick bonus CARV example of Deviation Support. When a stock breaks aggressively off-trend sometimes we see price action above +4 deviations (Very rare). +4 Deviations on CARV One year Chart is 19.47 -  [https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4](https://imgur.com/9s8DyP4)

## tldr, ape style

Old steel from car and machine has name ""scrap"" and use in make new steel cheaply and earth friend. Scrap very valuable when steel price go up.

China produce, consume, and export most world steel by big number. But China want less pollution and emission! Steel make many pollution and emission! To fix, China make less steel, export less steel, and use more scrap. **Now many less steel in world.**

World got sick and no make steel long time but now world feel better and need steel to build many thing like inferstucture and car and machine. But China not sending too many steel! **Steel price go up up up and away!** Scrap price go up too!!

But why matter SCHN??? USA long time make steel, many of that steel old now. So USA have big number high quality scrap. SCHN make money by collect and buy scrap all over USA then do export it all across whole wide world. **SCHN making moneys!!**

In future suit people tell steelmaker to use scrap for good earth weathers. Also China use new machines that use scrap to make steel. Demand for scrap go up! Not infinity scrap exist! **SCHN go up!**  🚀 🌚 🌝 🌚 🌝 🚀

China maybe very soon say ""we no more export steel"" and that make steel price go up more! Maybe even somebody buy SCHN because steel companies are come together now and they know control scrap be important for future!

Many thing to make SCHN go into sky and space! 🚀 🚀

# I. Short Term: An Update

This is a brief follow-up to my previous post:  [$SCHN: The Scrap Attack. (Part I: Balls of Steel)](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/).  You developmentally disadvantaged people of mental disability basically ignored it, but that's ok. I'm assuming you just went to go read a book and educate yourselves.

Anyway, the set-up is the same:

* SCHN dips post earnings due to discrapmination, and the SCHN/HRC spread widens.
* Steel stocks rise up into earnings since they're printing like crazy.
* HRC ramps up mid-month as usual
* SCHN takes the above as consent to express itself via candlestick boners
* Finally: cute little post-earnings-low-IV SCHN jumps up to 52w highs in a month or two

## Positions

Here's what happened yesterday, Jun 7:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of close Jun 7. Party's just getting started.](https://preview.redd.it/ryzbn23dk1a71.png?width=886&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2a6754652617bb06a94073f956a20e8a5d4f2208)

Here's today (Jun 8) @ 2pm:

&amp;#x200B;

[As of Jun 8 @ 2:00 pm](https://preview.redd.it/27rv3txdk1a71.png?width=889&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c85368ee2baa4981d737a831572dce16024a6379)

The IV remains low, with no bump up from [Tuesday's post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), because, congratulations, you guys didn't YOLO. Yes, IV is so low that a +2.59% day moves Aug 20 options up 30% and non-weekly FDs up 40% and 84%.

**Below is the updated chart:**

&amp;#x200B;

[Still plenty more to climb.](https://preview.redd.it/gps46kpek1a71.png?width=1697&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=69fa286b2c994ce5620c45d4f38e9e51f2c53eaa)

Still looks good to me. I still thinking we hit $55 by July and $60 by August, which would be multi-baggers.

Lastly, steelmakers earnings are coming up. If you're a believer in STEELGBTQ (steel goes big this quarter), then now's not a bad time to load up. Steelmakers will for sure absolutely demolish earnings this quarter, but it's debatable how the market will react. My take is they cannot ignore the amounts of cash coming in, and a flight to value has to start some time.

# IIa. Bananas

Imagine it's 1990. Nirvana is rocking the charts, and you grow and sell bananas. Business is good and you're able to sustainably expand your business slowly and surely. You pay your workers well and you're not too mean to the environment.

However, a new banana grower hits the scene across the world. They grow bananas with less regard for the environment and their workers. This makes their bananas cheaper to make. They ship the bananas all across the world for cheap, and rake in money. In the span of 30 years, they go from growing less bananas than you to growing almost 15x the bananas as you, and more than half of the whole world.

As the price of bananas plummet, banana growers across the world suffer. They can't afford to expand, and they don't. They barely scrape a living by and the only thing that keeps them alive is their country slapping taxes on bananas imported from the evil banana empire across the world.

The amount of bananas the world wants has grown, but the the only people who have increased their banana farms is the evil empire. For better or worse, the world has practically grown to rely on those cheap bananas coming in.

This continues for years. Until, rather quickly, those cheap bananas stop flooding in. Yet, the appetite for bananas remains the same. What happens now? **The price of bananas shoots up!**

**In fact, it's even more extreme than this: not only has the supply of bananas vanished, and demand stayed the same -- no, the demand for bananas has skyrocketed!**

You see, just a year ago, everybody got sick and nobody was making bananas for awhile. Sure, less bananas were being eaten, but stockpiles of bananas still fell. Then the world got better, and people's appetites for bananas exploded. All that time with no bananas... now they want to feast on bananas! They've even decided to build bridges, buildings, cars, and appliances out of bananas!

Whoa, so it's pretty awesome to make and sell bananas right now. Maybe it's time to expand your banana farms? Well, you see, that takes a lot of time, and a lot of money. It can't happen overnight. Furthermore, the last time you did this you got fucked by the evil banana empire.. so maybe this time you'll be more careful.

That's where we are at right now. Huge demand for steel that will last for a long time, and supply that's not coming back for a long time.

\---

# IIb. Steel: China, and the rest of the world.

This is the wrinkle version of the above section. Skip if you want.

Basically the dynamics of global steel are changing, and changing rapidly. On top of that, we are seeing immense economic growth. On top of that, we are coming out of COVID (which saw lower levels of production, and caused demand to pent up). **There is a lot of intersectionality going on, but it's the perfect storm for steel.**

## Before: China sets the price of steel.

China enjoys steel privileges, and they oppress the rest of the world's steelmakers. Look at just how much steel they manufacture:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces a lot of steel. A lot.](https://preview.redd.it/0y4yzy2hk1a71.jpg?width=1200&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=16511dae352ce8c711f7373cc9d6ec9c159d46c7)

Yeah, it's that crazy. China produces more than 9x the amount of steel of the #2 steel producer (India), and 6x all of Europe combined.

They also consume a fuck ton of steel. But, in the end, they're left with plenty of steel to export, which they've happily been doing. So much so, that for years they've driven the price of steel to the ground and nearly bankrupt the entire industry here in the US. **They export about 15-20% of all the steel in the world that is exported.**

&amp;#x200B;

[China exports a lot of cheap, dirty steel.](https://preview.redd.it/xy1cdyxhk1a71.png?width=745&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=829226b71f6879cbea70d3feb5168014076c0603)

While they may not export much directly to the US, the effect is that the world is flooded with cheap Chinese steel, and prices all over the world drop as a result.

## Now: China doesn't want to make so much steel.

Part of the reason Chinese steel was so cheap to make was that by the rest of the world's standards, they cut corners. The manner in which they produce steel produces a fuck ton of CO2 emissions as well as PM2.5, and I haven't looked into it but I'm sure there are better jobs to have than working in a Chinese steel mill.

If you don't know what PM2.5 is, it's particulate matter (dust, grains, etc) of size 2.5 microns or less. For reference, your hair is about 50-70 microns thick. **PM2.5s are habitual microaggressors and systemically oppress your lungs.**

Given the amount of steel China produces, the pollution is astronomical. Akin to 40 packs a day in some regions:

&amp;#x200B;

[PM2.5: Microaggressors everywhere](https://preview.redd.it/nn0zb0sik1a71.jpg?width=580&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=e8a87f329c2a4aee1cb92e0b7ec8e42fb1c59c75)

If you want to blame it on non-steel, then don't. You are part of the problem, not the solution. It is steel that is to blame. Read [this article](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-tangshan-steel/china-environment-minister-urges-crackdown-on-steel-mills-illegal-production-idUSKBN2B407Q)) and listen to their supreme-minister-of-whatever:

&gt;China has pledged to cut its crude steel output in 2021 from a record 1.06 billion tonnes it churned out last year to reduce carbon emissions. The steel sector accounts for 15% of China’s total emissions, topping all other manufacturing categories.  
&gt;  
&gt;“Steel companies are the main body responsible for air pollution...(they) should not just focus on performance and leave pollution to local people,” said Huang (Minister of Ecology and Environment)

Yeah, steel causes **15% of China's emissions** and probably a *much* higher percent of their poor air quality. This is because not only do they produce a fuck ton of steel, but also their efficiency at producing it sucks:

&amp;#x200B;

[China produces 2.5x the amount of CO2 per ton of steel.](https://preview.redd.it/og3g8drjk1a71.png?width=850&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=5a5d896524327eb40b0fba3877cd3599fdd15e17)

It's to the point where it's costing China human resources and money from people dying sooner and having health problems at a macro scale. It's also causing them geopolitical headache, as all eyes are on them to literally clean up their act.

**Thus, China is working to make their environment a safe space:**

1. Use the steel for yourself (you need it all for that 6% growth)
2. Stop exporting, so you can cut down production
3. Switch to cleaner ways of making steel

## China's walking the walk

It's not just talk, China is actually doing this.

* First, a decree of production cutbacks. Violators are probably sent to reeducation camps or some shit.
* Next, removing export rebate in May (#StopAsianRebate). This makes it less profitable to export.
* Next, fucking with domestic commodities prices, so that steel could remain cheap just for a little bit longer. In May, they increased margin requirements for commodities traders, causing them liquidate their positions and tanking steel prices.... temporarily.
* Meanwhile, they're building out EAFs.

**They want to make less steel, they want to keep it for themselves, they want it cleaner.**

\---

# III. EAFs and Scrapfirmative Action

By now you see why steel is expensive, and that there's a lot of incentive for China to produce it sustainably. So let's explore how that is done. Hint: scrap metal.

## How steel is made

Steel has two primary pathways to its production:

&amp;#x200B;

[BOFs on the left, EAFs on the right](https://preview.redd.it/jt0bvemlk1a71.jpg?width=593&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=6efb8ce2b59e770084fae3f865a27302661beda3)

Notice that both BOFs (basic oxygen furnaces) and EAFs (electrical arc furnaces) can take scrap as input. However, BOFs produce a lot more CO2.

&amp;#x200B;

[EAFs - the wave of the future.](https://preview.redd.it/83tqwvbmk1a71.png?width=999&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=f644892f2875ba0cdf2436cebd4d78fbefc67db1)

**EAFs are the future of steelmaking.** And EAFs love scrap.

## Cultural Appropriation

It's not just conjecture that China is moving towards EAFs, [it's a fact](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/032521-chinas-eaf-capacity-growth-to-slow-down-after-reaching-196-mil-mtyear-in-2021):

&gt;China's electric arc furnace, or EAF, steelmaking capacity will increase by 14.3 million mt/year in 2021 to about 196 million mt/year, accounting for 15% of China's total crude steel capacity, according to S&amp;P Global Platts Analytics. The net increase of China's EAF steelmaking capacity will be just 6.1 million mt/year in total over 2022-2023, according to Platts.

That's another 14.3 million mt of added EAF capacity this year, and another 6.1 million mt in 2022. **For reference, 20.4 million mt is about 30% of the US's** ***entire*** **steelmaking capacity -- this is what China is adding in a span** ***of just two years*****.**

**Curious why they aren't building more, even though they could? It's because they know scrap will become far more expensive in the near future.**

&gt;However, the growth of EAF capacity will slow down in 2022-2023, as **tight scrap supply** and expensive electricity will continue to undermine EAF steel's profitability.

In other words, the amount of scrap available is the bottleneck. Thankfully, here in the US we have a shit ton of scrap, and SCHN knows how to get it and how to sell it.

\---

# IV. Scrapping over Scrap

&amp;#x200B;

[Me, during the Floyd protests.](https://preview.redd.it/woh14ccnk1a71.jpg?width=3000&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=98b1e184c4d07462eb45f6055f8989b2ca318bd8)

So:

1. China is cutting back on exporting. 15-20% of the world's exported steel is diminishing.
2. Global steel demand is surging back with a vengeance.
3. China (and the world) are moving towards EAFs
4. EAFs + Scrap are the best way to make steel.

## The future fight for scrap

This whole thing about scrap is not some secret that I've discovered. It's been echoed by CEOs in the steel biz for some time now.

Lourenco Goncalves, AKA ""steelmaker of the year 2021"", the guy who told GS interns to kill themselves and loves it when shorts suffer, the guy who basically laid out the entire banana story I said earlier [*in fucking 2016*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeZIohZB4u4), the guy that knows *everything* about steel -- well he said this just a week ago:

&gt;**Prime scrap is the new precious metal.**

[Full video is here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY9uC79gUug) Very good watch, but trigger warning: it will cause you to get a boner with or without your consent.

Basically, the world of steelmaking is going to continue to shift towards EAFs, and government policies will shift towards cleaner steel. It doesn't get any cleaner than scrap, so everybody is going to fight over it, particularly China and the US (which has strict emission regulations).

## SCHN's take

Meanwhile, SCHN just reported earnings last week. [The babe in charge, Tamara Lundgren](https://www.google.com/search?q=Tamara+Lundgren+bikini&amp;tbm=isch) said this in the [earnings conference call](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-transcript.pdf):

&gt;Strong global demand for recycled ferrous continues to be driven by both cyclical and structural factors, including continuing economic recovery, benefits of government stimulus, tight supply, growth in EAF and the increased use of scrap in steelmaking.

Also:

&gt;The expected decrease in Chinese steel exports following the removal of their steel export rebate tax paired with higher Chinese steel demand is expected to increase overall ferrous scrap demand in Asia.

There are a wealth of other quotes in there. [Slides can be found here.](https://www.schnitzersteel.com/documents/2021-q3-earnings-conf-call-presentation.pdf)

Of note, the bump up in scrap demand from Asia is obvious:

&amp;#x200B;

[SCHN export destinations. Notice the Asia wedge getting bigger?](https://preview.redd.it/zahlm9mok1a71.png?width=461&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=9d9d7f6c25bd158c6c9318278241ba3fdabbabd9)

**So there you have it. Scrap is the future. It's time to become a proponent of scrapstainability, scrapversity, and scrapclusion.**

\---

# V. Catalysts

## Short Term

* As described in [my previous Schnitzer DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/of2qwj/schn_the_scrap_attack_part_i_balls_of_steel/), SCHN has shown itself to rise up after earnings, aided by steelmakers getting bid up into earnings and steel futures doing their mid-month rally.
* SCHN also seems to be leading the steel pack lately. Since earnings, it goes up more than the rest, it goes down less than the rest. The only exception is STLD, which got a boost from announcing $1b in buybacks. Yeah, steel is rolling in cash right now.
* A flight to value could happen at any time, but who the fuck knows anymore.
* Steel earnings coming up. 🌈 STEELGBTQ 🌈 (steel goes big this quarter).

## Long Term

Despite only making up 27.7% of steel production, Electric Arc Furnaces (EAFs) are going to be responsible for a huge surge in demand for scrap over the long run. The US, formerly the steel center of the world, has 100 years worth of high quality scrap laying around, and China doesn't. You wouldn't happen to know of any publicly traded US company with a vast network of scrap collection, technology to sort and process that scrap, and strategic export hubs to export that scrap, would you?

SCHN also makes for a very juicy acquisition target, which would make sense given the recent narrative of steel consolidating in the US.

Here is some analysis regarding Vertex’s operations, financials and future growth prospects…

&amp;#x200B;

*1.  TRIKAFTA*

*“Cystic fibrosis, a rare, progressive, life-threatening disease, results in the formation of thick mucus that builds up in the lungs, digestive tract, and other parts of the body. It leads to severe respiratory and digestive problems as well as other complications such as infections and diabetes. Cystic fibrosis is caused by a defective protein that results from mutations in the CFTR gene. While there are approximately 2,000 known mutations of the CFTR gene, the most common mutation is the F508del mutation. Trikafta is a combination of three drugs that target the defective CFTR protein. It helps the protein made by the CFTR gene mutation function more effectively. Currently available therapies that target the defective protein are treatment options for some patients with cystic fibrosis, but many patients have mutations that are ineligible for treatment. Trikafta is the first approved treatment that is effective for cystic fibrosis patients 12 years and older with at least one F508del mutation, which affects 90% of the population with cystic fibrosis or roughly 27,000 people in the United States” ­*– US Food and Drug Administration

Trikafta is the first FDA approved treatment for cystic fibrosis which is capable of treating 90% of patients with the disorder. Vertex currently has a firm **ECONOMIC MOAT** on medicinal treatment for cystic fibrosis as it is the only company with FDA approved drugs for treating the disorder. Trikafta accounts for 70% of Vertex’s revenues and has the potential to drive far more profit for the company with the massive expanding global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market. Grand View Research expects the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market to grow at a rate of 16.7% CAGR until 2025. Vertex could see growth which far exceeds that of this market due to its ever-growing share in the market. Essentially, the global cystic fibrosis therapeutics market growth rate + Trikafta’s market share growth rate would equate to Vertex’s revenue growth rate with Trikafta. With the drug’s increasingly large presence abroad due to the new approval in Canada as well as across Europe in several countries (57% increase in product revenue in Europe from 2020-2021), Trikafta could become an absolute **CASH-FLOW MACHINE** for Vertex. At the cost of $311,000 for Trikafta, Vertex could mass up to $8.4B in annual revenue if it were to capture the entire US market share alone. While the drug brought in just over $3.8B in 2020, there is still lots of room for Trikafta in Vertex’s domestic market, not to mention the great potential to scale internationally which has already been initiated.

*2.  GROWTH*

[Revenue Growth \(2015-Current\)](https://preview.redd.it/7hzv9l0zp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=c3c66e5eff78af0aa63fd3988708e95c3c42148f)

Revenue YoY Growth: **33.10%** **LTM**

Diluted EPS YoY Growth: **81.55%** **LTM**

Cash from Operations YoY Growth: **63.03%** **LTM**

Past 5 years Annual Earnings Growth: **53.9%**

As Trikafta’s patent has 16 years until expiry (expiry in 2037), Vertex’s largest source of revenue is here to stay and will continue to grow with the increasingly large demand for such treatment. Any new advances in pipeline for Vertex would also drive tremendous growth for additional revenues. On average, analysts are forecasting earnings growth greater than 20% for the upcoming year, however, with the average earnings surprise of 11.65% from the last four quarters, I believe that earnings growth &gt;30% is fair and to be expected.

Vertex’s **high return on equity** of 23.0% exceeds the industry average of 16.6% which demonstrates the company’s ability to successfully generate income and growth from equity financing – another positive and promising sign for future growth.

&amp;#x200B;

*3.  VALUATION*

[ Historical P\/E, EV\/EBITDA, EV\/Sales of VRTX \(2018-2021\)](https://preview.redd.it/8dfkcshxp7a71.png?width=2400&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=d3faef4300ca5119d50829d3ecdcc53c42b18f5d)

VRTX has become increasingly cheap over the past few years. The stock has risen significantly in the same time that its P/E multiple has significantly decreased. The stock now trades at 18.81x earnings 15.96x forward earnings, representing a 1.59 PEG. This puts VRTX far below the Nasdaq biotechnology industry average of 30x earnings. VRTX is currently **EXTREMELY CHEAP** based on the most common valuation metrics.

Based on a discounted cash-flow analysis of VRTX, an **intrinsic value of $406.58** can be extrapolated which presents a &gt;50% discount to its current share price of $197.74 (assumptions include a discount rate of 6.5% based on the calculation cost of equity).

This is all to say that VRTX has some serious **DEEP VALUE** and a return to industry average earnings multiples or simply maintaining a similar valuation based on earnings would provide drastic upside (&gt;50%) based on future outlook.

&amp;#x200B;

*4.  BALANCE SHEET*

&amp;#x200B;

[ Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Balance Sheet \(2021-03-31\)](https://preview.redd.it/k4xe9391q7a71.jpg?width=2928&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=593d17e2db8127251b49b9872368da61aad3ea98)

Quick Ratio: **4.20**

Current Ratio: **4.40**

Debt/Equity: **0.00**

LT Debt/Equity: **0.06**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals’ balance sheet is **extremely strong** with minimal debt relative to cash and current assets. The company has also made it clear that they are looking to use their large cash reserve for the acquisition of both drugs and of other pharmaceutical/biotech companies. There is virtually no risk debt-wise for Vertex – a rise in interest rates would not pose troubles to the company at all. Vertex’s current financial health is certainly the best in the biotech industry.

&amp;#x200B;

*5.  RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT*

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0mqkw3wvp7a71.jpg?width=1642&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=65f54a11041b71d7687257302149a0e7d8e9baf7

Vertex is in the process of developing several breakthrough therapies for serious diseases and has shown promising success with many of their clinical trials. FDA approval for any of these products would be highly significant for Vertex and extremely rewarding for shareholders. In the event that Vertex is successful in their cell therapy for type-1 diabetes, they could potentially **cure type-1 diabetes** and thus would consequently capture a large share of T1D market that is expected to grow to $24B by 2029\*. Vertex is continuing to advance in the development of molecular, cellular and genetic therapies aimed at treating many serious diseases. Overall, Vertex is in the process of developing revolutionary treatments that could significantly disrupt the biotech industry. Below is the stated progress on Vertex’s R&amp;D from the latest 10k…

*Beta Thalassemia and Sickle Cell Disease*

In December, we and our collaborator, CRISPR, announced positive interim data from 10 people with TDT or SCD treated with CTX001 and that 20 people with severe hemoglobinopathies have been dosed with CTX001 in the ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical trials. Enrollment and dosing are ongoing, and completion of enrollment in both clinical trials is expected in 2021.

*Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial for the corrector VX-864. We expect data from this clinical trial in the first half of 2021.

We discontinued development of VX-814, our first corrector, based on the safety and pharmacokinetic profile of VX-814 observed in a Phase 2 clinical trial.

*APOL1-Mediated Kidney Diseases*

Enrollment is ongoing in a Phase 2 proof-of-concept clinical trial designed to evaluate the reduction of proteinuria in people with APOL1-mediated FSGS after treatment with VX-147. We expect data from this clinical trial in 2021.

*Type 1 Diabetes*

We are developing a cell therapy designed to replace insulin-producing islet cells in patients with T1D. We are pursuing two programs for the transplant of these functional islets into patients: transplantation of islet cells alone, using immunosuppression to protect the implanted cells, and implantation of the islet cells inside a novel immunoprotective device. In January 2021, the FDA cleared our IND for VX-880, the islet cells alone program. We expect to initiate a Phase 1/2 clinical trial evaluating this program in the first half of 2021. This clinical trial will involve an infusion of fully differentiated, functional islet cells, and chronic administration of concomitant immunosuppressive therapy, to protect the islet cells from immune rejection. 

*Investment in External Innovation*

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Skyhawk Therapeutics, Inc., or Skyhawk, for the discovery and development of novel small molecules that modulate RNA splicing for the treatment of serious diseases. 

\-  We entered into a new collaboration with Moderna, Inc., or Moderna, aimed at the discovery and development of lipid nanoparticles and mRNAs that can deliver gene-editing therapies to lung cells for the treatment of CF. 

\-  We entered into a collaboration with Affinia Therapeutics, Inc., or Affinia, to gain access to a novel library of AAV capsids to support on our ongoing research and development efforts in genetic therapies, including DMD, DM1 and CF.

&amp;#x200B;

*6.  OTHER POSITIVE SIGNS*

·  $1.5B share repurchase program (June 2021-December 2022)

·  High net income margin: **49.00%**

·  Large hedge fund ownership

·  Average analyst price target **&gt;$260**

·  Buy-Strong Buy consensus across Wall Street

·  No underperform or sell targets

&amp;#x200B;

**TDLR:**

Vertex Pharmaceuticals presents remarkable upside for growth with their current products which are continuing to gain market share in an ever-growing therapeutics market, as well as with several breakthrough therapies which have shown to have promising results in recent clinical trials. Such high growth prospects paired with an undervalued company with solid financials makes for a great investment especially at the cheap price it is currently trading at.

&amp;#x200B;

I am long shares (around 15% of my total portfolio) but LEAPS would also be a great way to play VRTX

1105,"Housing a Big Bubbly Pile of Garbage that will soon be on Fire, a follow up to my Market Crash Post",1679.0,"So I made this [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/oe9ruu/how_to_play_the_upcoming_market_crash/) about how to play the coming market crash and a lot of you have been asking, both in the comments and messages, about why I think the housing market is fucked and bubbly and primed for a crash.  There's a bunch of reasons I'll get to shortly, but first lets take a little trip down memory lane to 2000-2001 in California when there were a bunch of rolling energy blackouts.

In 2000, California was getting hit with blackouts and high prices, power companies were failing, and it seemed like the crisis came out of nowhere.  I remember watching this on the news and being confused as to how Cali had power for all their stuff last week, but not this week, and all the press talked about how this was the new normal and people needed to get used to it/stop using so much power/people were too greedy with AC, etc. etc.  Then there was this one guy who came out and said Gov. Gray Davis should send the National Guard to seize the power plants and keep them on.  Everyone pointed and laughed at the crazy conspiracy guy.  Except, here's the kicker.  Crazy conspiracy guy was 100% right.  Enron was shutting down power plants to drive up demand and cause artificial shortages to make money.  When the blackouts and price spikes were happening, Cali had 45GW of installed power, and demand was running at 28GW.  Fuckery was afoot.

So, whenever I see something that doesn't make sense in any kind of market, I always wonder, is there a reason for this?  Or is it Fuckery?  Let's talk about the current boom in housing prices and why I suspect Fuckery.

All data is taken from the Fed and the US Census Bureau.  I left off decimals wherever possible because I know my audience can't do that kind of fancy math.

In 2004 (roughly the peak of US homeownership rates) the US homeownership rate was a bit over 69%.  In 2021 it's at 65%.  In 2004 there were 122 million housing units in the US.  In 2021 it's 141 million.  US population in 2004 was 292 million.  In 2021 it's 331 million.  Throw all these numbers into a blender and you get:

A 13% increase in population, a 4% decrease in homeownership rate, and a 15% increase in housing supply.  Yes, that's right, the housing supply has increased faster than the population, and the homeownership rate during that time has dropped.  So where the fuck is this crazy demand coming from?

Are people making more money?  Nope.  Workers share of corporate income has fallen from 79% in 2004 to 77% in 2021.  So in real terms wages are down.

Is it immigrants?  Nope, immigration has been falling for years.

Is it young people starting families?  Nope, family formation is close to all time lows and the oldest millennials who are approaching 40, are 20% poorer than boomers were at their age.

Is it inflation?  Nope, bond yields are currently signaling deflation, but the bond market has been wonky as fuck all year so who really knows.

So basically you've got more supply relative to population, construction of new units is slowing down - 1.8 million starts in Jan to 1.7 million starts in March down to 1.6 million starts in May, prices are rising, and sales are slowing.  Jan 6.5 million existing home sales, 993,000 new home sales.  May 5.8 million existing home sales, 769,000 new home sales.

So, to recap for the slower folks in the helmets on the short bus with the flavored windows:

**Prices: Up.  Wages: Down.  Supply relative to population: Up.  Demand: Down.  Sales: Down. Construction: Down.**

Yeah, it's a fucking bubble.  And clearly, Fuckery is Afoot.  Who is doing the fuckery and why I don't know.  Maybe it's Chinese nationals trying to get money out of the CCP's control, maybe it's AirBnB, maybe it's Blackrock and REIT ETF's, maybe it's something else entirely, but it's definitely a bubble, and it's definitely Fuckery.

**TLDR: Fuckery is Afoot.  It's a bubble.  Don't buy a house until the market crashes.  And remember, millions of units are waiting to come on the market once evictions start up again.**

Positions, same as the last post, puts on HYG because there are a lot of bullshit zombie companies that should have died years ago but are propped up by index investing and cheap corporate debt that the FED keeps buying, calls on SPXS because when this thing pops it's going to explode like nothing seen before to the point where Bigfoot and the Loch Ness Monster are going to sit around roasting marshmallows on the dumpster fire that used to be the stock market.

One last nugget about housing?  Residential Fixed Investment (it's a recession indicator, the acronym is apparently a banned ticker) was declining before the COVID crash, we were actually just starting a normal recession when that hit, which caused the FED to hit the panic button on the money printer.  On a 30 year or more chart SPY has been vertical since the COVID bottom.  Vertical lines in an index on a long term chart like that generally indicate the euphoria phase that precedes a massive crash.

My date range remains unchanged, sometime between June and November of this year.  If you want some specific dates to watch, check July 12th, July 19th, August 23rd, September 20th, and October 25th.  I probably like August 23rd the most of those, but I buy retard positions on WSB, so you definitely shouldn't listen to me.

EDIT: Sorry I've haven't updated this and am just now getting around to replies.  Got my first pump and dump shill DM, so that's an achievement unlocked I guess.

I just want to say how much I love all you beautiful retards.  Half the goddamn replies are ""housing is up where I live so there's no bubble""  The absolute best was the guy who pointed at a bunch of houses near him that have 10x'd in the last few years, and the one he just sold that nearly 2x'd in a year and a half.  Bro.  THAT IS THE FUCKING BUBBLE INFLATING.  Like, the sheer number of you who think pointing out high prices rising fast refutes instead of confirms my thesis is amazing.  Pure WSB retardation gold there.

To explain something else that I'm seeing mentioned a lot, renters ARE accounted for, so are multifamily households.  That's why I used total population and total houses and homeownership rate.  +40 million people and +20 million houses only works out to less supply if well more than half of those 40 million are living alone.  And spoiler, they aren't.  The decline in homeownership coincides with the increase in renters.

EDIT2: because I'm seeing a lot of ""but people own more than one house"" posts.  A pair of quotes:

""I own six houses.  And a condo.""   ""THERE'S A BUBBLE!!!""",2021-07-08 12:57:58,catbulliesdog

Expecting a big upward run in the coming future due to more construction and safer residential building requirement amid Miami Building Collapse!,4.0,"I am not a WSB Rocket Scientist and I don't catch rockets like ya'all do here with your GME AMC CLOVS AND WISH stonks. I am a full-time Structural Engineer and I am have heavily invested in BLDR (Builders First Source), one of the leading construction material suppliers in the US.

The company has an average price target to be $60 in 12 months among most of the analysts. Recently they bought out the software solutions system WTS Paradigm to increase their online capabilities and expected to make $50M revenue just from the WTS paradigm per year. BLDR has been profiting from the price hike on construction materials since the beginning of the pandemic as high demand and low supply caused massive price hikes. Also, the recent collapse of the Miami Residential Apartment building caused a shockwave in the housing and among the builders, engineers in the whole nation. Adding with the US withdrawal of troops from foreign lands and focusing on infrastructure building for the national future, I am highly convinced that BLDR will only grow in the coming days.

All major analysts have a BUY rating on this stock right now as the price dropped from ATH of 52.00 due to over-sell-off and profit-taking after a long bull run. But I believe it will get back to its ATH Position and once it hit that, it will be going toward the $65-$70 Range. A potential 40-50% upside is expected. Their third-quarter earning is coming in August and I have no doubt in mind it will be higher than expected EPS. This coming earning call increases the price of the stock as well.
