My mother always told me that when I would complain about arbitrary treatment. I would play by the rules and someone else would ignore them. When they would win I would appeal to the first authority for an explanation. ""Are you going to let them get away with this""? ""Life isn't fair"". No, it is not. The game is the game. Always.

In this moment, the fascade cracks further. When the first breach was made I do not know, perhaps it was Socrates, but today I see thousands. Millions. 

Once they were laughing, luxuries falling out of their disgusting diseased mouths as they cackled. The unmistakable stench of derision carried on their breath. They told anyone outside of their elite class that we were fools for even trying. They told us that we were naive. We needed networks to be successful. We needed polish. We needed expertise. We needed THEM. The game is the game. Always. 

They are no longer laughing. Their odious oeuvre still wafts through the air. While the rot, and hate, and condescention, remains, the noxious air betrays a new addition. Something all together disconcerting. What it betrays, is fear. They are afraid. And they should be. We do not need their inherited resources masked as acumen. A new day dawns. The day where we make an ever so slight step towards what they fear the most. An even field. Life becoming ever so slighty more fair.   AND. THEY. ARE. SCARED. They look at us and see roughness. We look at them and see softness. We are both correct in our estimation.

The game is the game. Always.

Fuck them in the street. Fuck them all in the street. We are the righteous. We are blessed by Phoebe. What started here will echo through time in the eons to come. Mount up and ride with the fury of a thousand rockets into the universal filament. May the wind always be at your back and the sun upon your face.

Some of these companies like GME, AMC are good companies that's been hit hard by this pandemic. Hedgefunds and Wallstreet just want to short these companies to zero and make millions. 

 I really think right now we have enough support and enough of us to change that direction in history. Wallstreet says  well weak companies need to just go. 10 yrs down the road though I want to be able to watch a movie in a movie theater with my family. If we all buy and hold in what we believe in it gives these companies a second chance and we as a group can stop these companies from being shorted to death and just disappear.

You think GME squeezed hard? Look what happened to silver half a year ago in July:

That's one of the banks getting squeezed out of silver, having to cover their shorts... and that's just because rich boomers freaked out about financial instability and finally started calling out the Comex on their bullshit, and taking physically delivery of silver... which they don't have.

Now imagine 4 million degenerates buying $SLV, forcing the trust to take delivery of physical silver from the Comex. This isn't GME, who's fair price is maybe around $5 a share. The FAIR price of silver based on the historical gold/silver ratio is almost surely over $50/ounce. This short squeeze will be a fantastic success even if we can take silver to it's fair market value.

And then there's $AG. Because once silver starts moving, $AG is going to go to the fucking moon. 1) it's a leverage play on silver, 2) It's got it's OWN SHORTS TO BE SQUEEZED OUT. At least a 23% short float as of last count: [https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm](https://shortsqueeze.com/shortinterest/stock/AG.htm)

Paper hands should be ashamed to succumbing to the pressure from dementor hedge funds.

I would also like to preface this post with the fact that this is not a war on billionaires, the wealthy yada yada, but it may well be described as a resistance against injustice, inequiality, poverty, rigged rules, uneven playing field etc which has been rampant on Wall Street forever.

Billionaires are not baddies, at least not all of them. It's what they decide to do with their wealth that is the problem. Using one's wealth perpetuate inequality and injustice is not cool. If all hedge funds were dismantled tomorrow, there will be absolutely no negative consequences to society or social fabric. Hedge funds are not the greatest capital allocators. In fact they are shit at it and the last couple of weeks have proven it.

Sending lots of love to the following billionaires / millionaires: Elon, Chamath, Ryan Cohen, even Warren Buffet and Dr Michael Burry

Fuck you's: Gabe Plotkin (Melvin Capital), Steve Cohen (Point72), Leon Shaulov and Rob Crespi (Maplelane Capital), Ken Griffin (Citadel)

\------------------------------------------------

Now to the main part. What you fellow degenerates, smooth-brains and soft-heads have discovered is called a 'market inefficiency' and are correcting it. The market is acting exactly like it's intended to act. **You are not the problem, you are actually the solution.**

***Why fundamentals don't matter?***

Fundamentals stopped mattering the moment $GME's short interest breached 100% of the available float. See, markets should work as a two way function (you should be able to derive x from y and y from x). There is no possibility at all to buy more than 100% of the available float at any point in time, so why would it be possible to short more than 100% of the float? Why would the market allow such an asymmetric property? Well it shouldn't and the market would and is correcting that.

***So what does matter?***

What really matters now is first principles. Yes, exactly like Papa Elon resumes most of his thought processes as far away from foolish abstractions (read 'fundamentals') down to first principles, this is exactly the same thing what the market is doing right now.

The fools at CNBC (fuck you Wapner - hope you are reading this), CNN, Boomerberg have described the price as being irrational, devoid of logic and reason. So let's break this down for them starting from first principles, Economics 101.

Supply and demand form the most crucial concepts of economics. Whether you are an academic, farmer, banker, hedge fund loser, smooth-brain redditor or a CNBC reporter, the basic premise of supply and demand equilibrium is integrated into your daily actions. Only after understanding the basics of this can the more complicated aspects be mastered.

So let's look at the demand and supply of $GME shares

Demand side:

* Bullish investors - it is no secret that a lot of the investors have taken a position after the narrative around $GME's business model and future prospects are significantly more optimistic with Ryan Cohen now in the driving seat. Now that brankruptcy is out of the question, it is for each investor to decide what the fair value for the stock is. I will leave this part to each one of you individually, as I am just a degenerate smooth-brain redditor that doesn't know shit.
* MMs (no, not market manipulators, just market makers) - these guys sold a ton of short-dated call options to you and haven't learned a shit from what happened last Friday. They are going exactly the same path this friday. There are now around 300k of OI that are ITM (probably more by end of today), which translates into 30M shares that need to be found to the option holders by EOD tomorrow.
* SS (no not the nazi troops, jsut the short sellers) - yeah, you know exactly what's going on here, since this is the essence of the story. Short sellers borrowed around 70M shares and must get them at any price.

Supply side:

* Float - these are the shares that are openly traded and exchange hands every day. Around 51M shares (probably less since you all have diamond hands)
* Share issuance - the company can decide to issue new shares. I believe $GME shelf issuance ammount is around $100M. At yesterday's share price of $347, that's only 0.3M shares. But let's round up to 1M

So what do we get:

Demand = 30M from MMs + 70M from SSs + 10M from bullish investors (this number is out of thin air, I have no clue what it should be). **Total demand: 110M**

Supply = 51M from float + 1M from share issuance. **Total supply: 52M**

Demand / Supply ratio: 2.1x

I will let CNBC, Boomerberg, CNN find another security, commodity, bond or whatever that has that demand / supply ratio and then make judgement on the price for $GME shares.

Finally, *the invisible hand* is a metaphor introduced by the 18th-century Scottish philosopher and economist Adam Smith, characterizes the unseen forces that move the free market economy. It is that very invisible hand that came back to slap the shit out of the 'masters of the universe' hedge funds that decided to ignore the most basic principles of economics.

If any of the hedge fund dementors read this, note that the free market will always, always humble you and put you back where you belong. Fuck you!
